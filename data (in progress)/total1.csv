Glaucus Research said Ozner was a ""real working business"" but with margins and a market share much smaller than as portrayed by the company. In the 47-page report, Glaucus Research also cited undisclosed related party transactions, Chinese government tax records corroborating income at a fraction of reported figures, and other ""accounting shenanigans."" Glaucus Research predicted the company had 76-92% downside. On 3-26-2015, Glaucus Research posted a rebuttal to Ozner's response, saying that Ozner had admitted to making a statement that was ""not entirely accurate,"" but which it said was immaterial. Glaucus said this called the company's word into question. Glaucus also said the response contained ""evasions and excuses which are directly contradicted by Ozners prior statements in its prospectus or in its statutory filings in the PRC."" The company's stock resumed trading and closed up 14%. On 4-2-2015, Glaucus Research responded to Ozner's second response, calling it a ""joke."" Glaucus particularly highlighted several times when the company acknowledged in its responses to Glaucus that it had misstated something. Glaucus continued to stress that the SAIC filings showed a significantly worse financial position for the company.","SAIC Filings Indicate Material Exaggeration of Sales, Production and Profit.

Razor99 noted that the company's profitability was the result of significantly higher revenue per employee versus peers. It also said that the company chairman had pocketed more than RM$1.0 billion through stock sales and dividends, while minority shareholders had contributed more than RM$550 million of the company's net capital.","Page?REPORT OUTLINESection 1:Complex and Deceiving Corporate StructureSAL  has  a  complicated  history  and  group  structure,  with  numerous  related  party  transactions  with opaque  private  entities  controlled  by  Goh.  We  believe  this  structure  was  designed  to  confuse  and deceive minority shareholders. We outline the important events in the development of the Silverlake Group to provide the context in which Goh has perpetrated fraud.Section 2:Alarming Reliance on Related Party TransactionsSALs extensive use of related party transactions with Gohs private companies is a red flag. Until 2009, related-party transactions accounted for the vast majority of SALs revenue and today they still account for nearlyone-quarter of revenue and expenses. The rationale and justification for these related-party transactions is flimsy and their existence creates significant potential for fraudulent abuse. We believethat some or all of the related party revenueis fictitious and is used to inflate SALs reported profits. Frequent share placements likely help Goh fund the fictitious related party revenue through his private companies.Section 3:Self-Dealing and Related Party Acquisition Red FlagsWe outline four related-party asset injections into SALwhich establish a clear pattern of deceit and abuse of minority shareholders. Aided by data from the Companies Commission of Malaysia and analysis of related party transactions, we show how Goh systematically inflated profitability of the businessespriorto injectingthem intoSAL. In this way, he used dubious financial reports to extract unreasonably high prices from minority shareholders for his own personal gain.Section 4:Large UndisclosedLoss-Making Related Parties are Contingent LiabilitiesWe discovered the existence of large related party Silverlake private companies which are loss making with negative shareholders equity, and which only continue to operate withan explicitguarantee of financial support from Goh. These entities are known to have ongoing related party transactions with SAL, and they have a combined cost base almost as large as SAL with almost as many employees. We think  these  entities  are  being  used  to  flatter  the  reported  profitability  of  SAL.  In  reality,  they  are contingent liabilities to SAL that should be disclosed as such in the annual report.Section 5:Undisclosed Off-Balance Sheet DebtWe found undisclosed, off-balance sheet debt which was recourse to SAL at the time of the IPO. If Goh was willing  to  hide  contingent  liabilities  at  that  time,  we  worry  that  hidden  off-balance  sheet  and recourse debt may still exist in some Silverlake Group companies.Section 6:Chairmans History of Cashing Out at the Expense of Minority ShareholdersSALs financials have been cleverly manipulated to entice minority shareholders, but an analysis of cash flow clearly shows that Goh is the one who is benefiting. Goh has been able to pocket more than RM 1.0 billion (US$300 million) through stock sales and dividends, while minority shareholders have contributed more than RM 550 million (US$165 million) of net capital into SAL.We also note a highly suspicious contract with Chinas HNA Group in 2010 where the S$70 million contract was secured for SAL in exchange for part of Gohs personal shareholding in SAL stock, worth more than S$35 million at the time. Finally, we highlight that although reported revenue and net profit have grown at a rapid pace because of related-party asset injections, EPS has only increased at a 5.4% CAGR due to frequent dilutive related-party deals.",Business Fraud,Related party transactions;managerial self-dealing;managerial plunder;possible fraud,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Silverlake Axis Ltd.,Singapore,fy2015,0,GV_256220,Silverlake Axis Ltd,IQ8080671,Software,SGX:5CP,320.5142,516.04315,282.65302,12.031,178.93497,4.41932,332.5452,178.93497,0.00404,130.2155,337.10818,12.18139,140.2398,65.93837,0,0,0,16.33234,477.2434,0,0,22.314,0,-9.36081,12.86857,271.16981,0,130.45495,2.9607,0,156.36765,285.02368,0,779.03413,21.80552,305.47347,17.88908,306.8292,-2.1235,0,24.16641,0.63497,0,282.66279,-13.22624,0.78452,0,0,118.04757,0,-0.88241,0,282.65302,-35.29755,1.62641,0,69.45014,0.07138,0,0,139.61642,282.65302,0,0,282.65302,0,157.48316,0.10527,0,328.11701,0.10527,-1.62017,-7.92663,2684.92312,-1.62017,639.34633,0.1052,0,639.41771,0.1052,-7.87198,779.03413,2685.8875,0,0.06634,0,0.06632,42655,42185,275.58912,-285.75036,2693.57893,281.1164,-295.24251,2693.57893,94.65061,(Invalid Formula 0me),271.16981,0.23736,278.91881,482.97869,3.32969,0.11978,0.17931,178.13004,25.74516,2.41093,0,-1.62017,0.78452,7.8761,215.64263,1.62641,101.0958,215.71749,-330.13428,0.11074,-23.89625,641.82863,21.89199,273.46563,0,2.27443,559

Bleecker Street said FBI raids cracking down on insurance fraud in Florida, where 51% of the company's beds were located, would put the company's revenues at risk. Bleecker Street also said that the company had manipulated its earnings ahead of its IPO to boost its valuation, that it had a ""checkered past"" and that it would have a lockup expiration in a few weeks. On 8-4-2015, Bleecker Street said in a follow-up report that AAC's ability to raise money to fund acquisitions had been badly compromised by the recent murder indictment of its former president (and 25% shareholder) and its Forterus unit, which made up 20% of the company's revenue. Bleecker Street also noted that there was evidence of other undisclosed patient deaths, and it said that AAC had not disclosed that the indictment was for murder even though the company had ample time to review the indictment beforehand. ","AAC Holdings, also known as American Addiction Centers, is likely to fall by at least 50%, as its inappropriate insurance billing scheme comes unraveled. Moreover, this contributes to outsized net margins. In fact, it is so profitable that the company will not reveal the margins, and it doesn't really even want to talk about it. The company is already the subject of one lawsuit (in New Jersey) alleging fraudulent billing with respect to excessive urine testing. I believe that the majority of this growth has to do with excessive and/or fraudulent drug testing. In April 2014 AAC acquired Clinical Revenue Management Services, LLC ""CRMS"" as part of its reorganization transactions. This was an interesting move and served to help inflate AAC's revenue and earnings just ahead of the IPO. You can see how drastic this change was by looking at AAC's ratio of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts to Revenue. It is not hard to see when it started falling, right after the CRMS acquisition and when management changed the allowance for doubtful accounts helping boost earnings before the IPO.",Legal Headwinds,Major Business Fraud;Accounting fraud;Product not as valuable as perceived;unsavory management,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"AAC Holdings, Inc.",NYSE,fy2015,1,GV_178698,"AAC Holdings, Inc.",IQ262747167,Health Care Facilities,NYSE:AAC,18.75,194.148,11.174,0,107.16,7.837,18.75,107.16,-1.775,60.934,86.988,5.757,60.934,33.335,0,0,0,-46.097,86.524,7.837,0,124.365,0,5.061,109.724,23.108,0,0,-3.607,0,118.192,20.226,0,316.049,-7.105,6.193,7.878,13.121,-51.525,0,4.78,0,4.806,8.341,-91.085,0,0,0,34.337,0,-0.54,140.799,11.174,0,0,0.681,-143.402,-5.166,-3.401,0,179.561,10.493,0,0,10.493,0,0.023,0.48567,0,19.708,0.48567,-29.059,0,21.60504,-29.059,141.654,0.48,0,136.488,0.48,0,316.049,21.66126,0,0.71623,-8.529,0.71437,43154,42369,30.945,0,22.81381,30.945,107.419,22.98536,-29.79,(Invalid Formula 0me),23.108,6.20913,36.243,23.462,5.298,3.404,1.02841,15.47425,1.25,145.605,0,-29.059,4.806,36.4301,-45.09488,140.799,0,-43.1015,126.855,0,19.273,282.093,3.865,-20.58,1400,0.915,562

Prescience said the company had no excess cash, due in part to 40+ acquisitions, and Prescience noted deferred cash bonuses to management and ""dramatic increases"" in stock-based employee compensation packages. Prescience additionally said that the company was making a concerted effort to mask waning organic growth. It said the company was doing so to mislead investors and that a restatement of the company's financial results would be needed in the future. Prescience said the decrease in management ownership in the company to 2.3% reflected the company's precarious circumstances. On 2-12-2013, Prescience released a follow-up report and stated that the company's revenue problems were ""worse than initially suspected."" Prescience said the company was covering up significant intra-period borrowing, that it continued to have significant problems integrating its many acquired businesses and products and that insider selling and departures in management indicated the company's continued decline.
","Trading with a $600 million fully diluted market valuation (16.5x LTM EBITDA), we believe shares of The Active Network, Inc. ( ""the company,"" ""Active,"" or ""ACTV"" ) are grossly overvalued, reflecting few, if any, of the serious risks that could threaten its existence. We believe that management has resorted to masking the company's weakening financial condition by gaming the accounting, and reducing investor disclosures. As a result of our serious concerns about the integrity of its financial reporting, we believe Active is at high risk of being forced to restate historical financial results. We believe investors and sell-side analysts have been sold a bill of goods that Active is a high growth SaaS/Cloud leader. Our analysis paints a starkly different picture, and it appears management and insiders agree by price-indiscriminate share liquidations. It rapidly burned through its strong, post-IPO excess cash position. We believe it now has no excess cash.
It recently doubled its line of credit in July 2012 with no explanation.
It deferred management cash bonuses that were to be paid earlier in the year into Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) in August.
It undertook sudden managerial changes, effectively removing the company's long-tenured CEO, thereby cutting his salary.
It is the subject of increasingly frequent customers complaints claiming that Active is engaged in fraudulent billing practices.
It may be having trouble retaining employees, evidenced by dramatic increases in stock-based compensation expenses. Initially expected to be $3.5m for 2012, analysts are now expecting an expense of $15m.
It has made no cash or equity-based acquisitions YTD, which is at odds with management's prior guidance for acquisitions in 2012 and with the company's historical pattern.
It has stretched to the maximum the number of days to pay money owed to event organizers, a measure we refer to as Days Due to Customers Outstanding.",Accounting Fraud,business model pressure;accounting misrepresentation;Cash shortage;Too many acquisitions;Managerial self-dealing;Growth overstated;Insider selling;Management turnover;organic growth overstated,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Active Network, Inc.",NYSE,fy2012,1,GV_160281,"Active Network, LLC",IQ168182,Software,-,58.493,418.893,-43.026,0,191.819,43.915,58.493,191.819,0,67.623,227.074,16.728,67.623,163.015,0,4.809,81.408,1.849,140.992,0,-3.147,97.313,22.277,-0.237,41.236,-39.626,11.894,0,-0.577,0,357.673,-40.169,0,542.47,1.123,27.552,8.174,-39.046,-17.765,0,3.98,0,0,-43.026,-38.175,2.774,0,0,182.304,0,-23.026,0,-43.026,0,2.462,0,-78.966,0,0,0,210.023,-43.026,10,0,-43.026,10,0.062,-0.73168,0,-318.284,-0.73168,-19.73,-11.959,58.804,-19.73,332.447,-0.73168,10.955,332.447,-0.73168,0,542.47,58.804,0,-0.42694,0,-0.42694,41332,41274,4.289,0,60.89414,4.289,1.225,60.95381,-50.206,(Invalid Formula 0me),-39.626,5.45943,18.489,-25.226,14.2,0.573,-0.41426,-25.10563,1.35,5.236,0,-9.73,2.774,NM,-33.31525,2.462,0,-32.90025,-53.257,0,45.386,337.683,2.627,-13.476,3036,1.353,172

GeoInvesting believed that $276.9 million in losses went unreported between 2009 and 2012. In addition, the report claimed AmTrust was boosting earnings and book value by marking up its portfolio of life settlement contracts well above the industry standard. GeoInvesting also questioned the integrity of AmTrust management, based on the fact that its CFO and COO had been accused of actively covering up fraud at Credit General (liquidated in 2001), whose CEO had stolen $30 million from the company.","Owners of AFSI should take careful note of the discussions of consolidation of earnings and valuation of assets that could result in large losses and regulatory scrutiny for the company. We will show that AFSI appears to be inflating earnings/net equity via offshore entities, making it difficult for regulators to see the complete picture and/or get accurate information. A cross section of public documents (AFSI SEC filings, Statutory financial filings by AFSI subsidiaries and Credit Rating information) shows that AFSI appears to be excluding losses of wholly-owned subsidiaries in its SEC filings
From 2009 to 2012 we believe that AFSI has not disclosed a total of $276.9 million in losses ceded to Luxembourg subsidiaries.
AFSI seems to be mismarking its LSCs by using egregiously aggressive assumptions relative to peers despite lawsuit documents showing AFSI holds many policies which are probably worthless.
Applying industry standard discount rates would result in an impairment/markdown of $90-$135 million in AFSI LSCs.
These findings regarding AFSI's LCSs are especially troublesome since more than half of the policies held by AFSI are of contracts where Phoenix Life Insurance, (NYSE:PNX) (see footnote 1) is the issuing carrier / counterparty. Since PNX and/or its subsidiaries are faced with possible bankruptcy, its ability to honor the payout on these policies could be diminished and AFSI's expected collection on these contracts would be even less than other comparable policies.

Einhorn said Allied was improperly carrying its investments above market value by failing to appropriately mark down assets. Einhorn also criticized treatment of subsidiary Business Loan Express (BLX), noting that Allied gave almost no information on the subsidiary's holdings.  showing that BLX's portfolio was performing far worse than even Greenlight thought, defaulting three times more often than the average SBA loan. Einhorn said that Allied urged shareholders to move their shares out of margin accounts and into cash accounts in order to prevent brokerages from lending their shares to short-sellers. In addition, in August 2002, Allied filed preliminary documents with the SEC to do a rights offering that appeared to be intended to force a short squeeze (Allied intended to issue non-transferable rights that complicated the clearing and settlement process, thus forcing short-sellers to cover). However, after Einhorn wrote a letter to the SEC to complain, Allied amended the rights offering to remove the questioned feature. According to Einhorn's book, Einhorn wrote a letter to the the board in March 2005, ""informing them that BLX engaged in a huge fraud against the SBA and United States taxpayers."" The company dismissed Einhorn's concerns. According to Einhorn's book, in December 2005, Greenlight Capital and Jim Brickman jointly filed a qui tam whistleblower suit against Allied Capital, related to allegedly fraudulent shrimp boat loans. (In September 2006, the Justice Department declined the suit, so Greenlight and Brickman continued the suit on their own.) Einhorn also said Greenlight filed several FOIA requests for access to BLX's regulatory filings.","While Mr. Einhorn did share Greenlight's thesis that Allied Capital has mismarked its portfolio, benefits from low quality earnings streams, and depends on premium stock sales to grow its net asset value and support the dividend, he made no personal attacks against Allied's management. Allied Appears to have Created Its Own Accounting Methods. Allied has produced a ""white paper"" with its interpretation of fair value accounting. Allied appears to be openly flaunting SEC requirements. Allied believes that, ""the Small Business Administration Policy is far more applicable to the portfolio of a Business Development Company than the valuation guidance set forth by the SEC.""

Specifcally, he noted that a series of bad news events for the company had not lowered the stock price at all. According to Pearson, these events included the company's main product, ALN_RSV01, failing its phase II trial, losing a lawsuit, selling a spinoff that ended up being priced low, and failing to be on track to bring five new drugs to market by 2015, a stated goal. He highlighted another biotech stock, Isis, that had considerably more drugs in phase II and phase III than Alnylam but was also valued at $1.5 billion. He further noted that company insiders had been buying the stock below $10 a share but had since become net sellers.","The past 12-14 months have seen a very strong rally in the overall markets, sending the Nasdaq index to levels not seen in 13 years. Biotech stocks have largely been leading the pack and have provided spectacular returns to those who have been chasing the ultra-high beta returns. A significant uptick in insider and company selling indicates that those who are in a position to know the most are well aware that the valuation has run well ahead of the companys clinical progress or commercial prospects. In May 2012, Alnylams lead product ALN-RSV01 failed its Phase II trial. This product was the companys most advanced product, and one of only two products by Alnylam to make it past Phase I.
Shortly thereafter, Alnylam lost a lawsuit with Tekmira (TKMR) which had cited relentless and egregious misappropriation of its trade secrets. The two companies had worked together since 2004. Alnylam was forced to pay an immediate $65 million plus an additional $10 million in potential milestones to Tekmira.
The spinoff IPO of Alnylams Regulus (RGLS) unit, a joint venture with IsisPharma, ended up pricing at $4.00, 60% below the indicated range of $10.00-$12.00. Alnylam owns 17% of Regulus.
As shown below, Alnylams 5×15 Product Strategy predicting five products in late-stage development by 2015 is now looking more like a 1×16 Strategy or perhaps a 2×17 Strategy at best.

Citron said that Amedisys ran huge receivables that grew 20% in the prior year but that its receivable reserves varied widely, and Citron said that an over 20% reduction in Amedisys' reserve percentage was responsible for the company's ""blowout"" quarter. Citron also raised concerns that the company's Medicare reimbursement for current work was falling but was cloaked by Amedisys' growth in revenues from acquisitions. It said that interviews with former employees showed that Amedisys pressured employees to manipulate OASIS scores in order to increase billings, and Citron said the company's questionable Medicare billing practices needed deeper scrutiny. On 10-15-2009, Citron said that correspondence with former Amedisys employees indicated that the company manipulated treatment plans and patient assessments to maximize Medicare reimbursement rates, and Citron noted that Medicare reimbursement accounted for 87% of Amedisys' revenues. Citron also said that Amedisys had received numerous Additional Document requests from Medicare and that the government's enforcement abilities had increased. Citron noted abrupt and unexplained executive departures, and it added that the company's CIO had departed, which Citron said was significant because its Point of Care program was specifically designed to prompt workers to skew OASIS scoring for higher reimbursement. Citron additionally said that it was common practice for coding managers to send OASIS correction forms for cases that did not meet the optimum billing and reimbursement profile.","fraud on the insurance reimbursement system.

The report also raised concerns regarding the viability of the company's alternative fuel production. In addition, Street Sweeper highlighted that the company had materially diluted shareholders' stock through a series of public offerings and predicted that a further issuance of convertible notes was in the works. On 5-6-2014, Street Sweeper published a second report following Amyris' annual 10-K filing. According to the report, the company's 10-K contained ""going concern"" language suggesting that Amyris was in serious danger due to its contractual obligations and level of debt. The report highlighted a $25 million debt financing deal containing onerous terms and stated that Amyris would be at risk of default. The report also referred to recent insider sell offs.","But a more truthful headline would have read: Amyris Financial Results Not So Bad: After All, Were Claiming Debt and Advances as Revenue (or Strong Collaboration Inflows). The company would like investors to believe revenues are nearly double the real numbers. The company wants investors to think it turned a $38 million gross profit. But it really suffered a $6.5 million loss.

The company would also like investors to believe the truest measure of net income  EBITDA  is just a negative $46 million instead of the real figure  a negative $109 million.

Indeed, a Securities and Exchange Commission task force is investigating such non-GAAP measurements. The concern is these metrics have the potential to mislead investors about the true nature of any given companys business. Under its business plan, Amyris hopes in the next few years to commercialize diesel and jet fuel. But our research indicates this plan is doomed. Sadly, investors shouldnt hold out hopes that Amyris can fool Mother Nature and get higher yields. Organic chemists know that, at best, the chemical process can cook up only a 27 percent yield.

The report primarily pointed to the company's ""value destroying investment binge"" overseas, making illiquid investments in risky markets that underperformed government bonds. Moreover, Muddy Waters also pointed to a significant misstatement in the company's accounts, which Muddy Waters believed could amount to fraud. The report identified a $250 million discrepancy between what AMT claimed to have paid for an acquisition of towers in Brazil and the actual selling price. Muddy Waters also took issue with AMT's poor corporate governance and its transaction-focused compensation model that rewarded unmanaged risks. The report predicted a decline for the tower industry based on new technology alternatives and valued AMT at $44.57, a downside of 40.3%.","It has engaged in a value destroying investment binge overseas, and we have identified a significant material misstatement in the Companys accounts that could amount to fraud. There is an approximately US$250 million discrepancy between what AMT claims to have paid for the acquisition of towers in Brazil, and the actual selling price. AMT claimed to have paid US$585.4 million for the towers, but the real price was close to US$300 million. If AMT is aware of this discrepancy, it would amount to fraud. We have provided our research to the SEC. CEO James Taiclets consistent sales of approximately 90% of the shares he receives from option exercises suggests a lack of faith in the sustainability of AMTs business  ironically, this is a view we share with him.
AMTs international business is in part a de facto lending business that artificially inflates revenue, EBITDA, and AFFO. It is also part carry trade and part levered directional currency bet. This bet has resoundingly gone south this year.
AMTs international IRRs are generally poor and far below cost of capital.
While wireless data usage will grow, much of this growth will circumvent cellular towers. Wi-Fi and more recently introduced technologies are making towers the data delivery option of last resort.

This short-term nature is not reflected in the recent 10Q, due to an accounting technicality that has been missed. More serious accounting issues may have also been missed.

Creditors have already assumed as collateral ALL of Aemetis' assets, and are now sweeping cash from Aemetis every night. Some creditors are attempting to seize assets.

Aemetis recently filed a $100-million S3, and retained an investment bank to advise on financing. A massive near-term equity offering is the only option for Aemetis.

According to a brief summary of the remarks, Bozza said that Arista Networks faced steep competition from Cisco and others, which would destroy the company's margins. On 2-5-2015, ValueWalk published some more detail about the rationale of Lakewood Capital's Arista Networks short, quoting extensively from Lakewood's shareholder letter. Lakewood said that Arista had been ""awarded a remarkable valuation based on an unsustainable first mover advantage"" which it could not maintain. Lakewood said that Cisco had responded to Arista with a product that had ""near identical functionality at the same low price point."" Lakewood also said two ongoing lawsuits posed a ""significant threat"" to the company and saw 50% downside to the stock.
","Arista Networks increased revenues from $72 million in 2010 to almost $600 million today. Lakewoood Capital emphasized that its heady growth attracted investors attention, but the investment firm believes that Arista Networks is poised to face a more challenging environment over the next quarters.

Lakewood Capital emphasize that Cisco Systems, the leading networking company worldwide launched a competing product, the Nexus 9000, which offers a nearly similar functionality at the same low price point. Cisco also started a price war, and it is bundling switches with other data center products, which makes it more competitive than Arista Networks.The company is also facing a lawsuit filed by its co-founder and 22% shareholder David Cheriton and another patent litigation filed by Cisco.",Product ineffective,competitive headwinds;Product not as valuable as perceived;Regulatory headwinds,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,"Arista Networks, Inc.",NYSE,fy2015,1,GV_020748,"Arista Networks, Inc.",IQ33348547,Communications Equipment,NYSE:ANET,687.326,837.591,121.102,0,294.031,13.671,687.326,294.031,0,144.263,543.56,45.303,144.263,184.804,0,92.129,209.448,-47.281,974.328,0,-14.123,110.045,0,9.037,79.706,149.308,90.34,36.636,-3.152,32.018,0,146.009,0,1159.89,0,237.784,43.966,146.009,-19.989,0,24.907,0,0,121.102,0,1.29,0,0,235.011,0,0,0,121.102,208.2,41.21,1.987,184.17,0,0,0,371.738,119.115,0,0,119.115,0,0.007,1.80576,0,250.916,1.80576,-1.086,0,65.964,-1.086,788.152,1.67011,27.201,788.152,1.67011,0,1159.89,71.411,0,1.38342,0,1.27789,43151,42369,162.979,0,68.132,162.979,25.854,68.27393,447.295,(Invalid Formula 0me),149.308,11.56802,168.379,788.152,5.4,2.999,11.56802,91.25563,6.591,42.5,0,-1.086,1.29,17.0585,163.7875,41.21,0,165.7575,-644.826,0,-33.455,830.652,50.794,142.99,1200,-25.887,575

A major investor, well aware of the bullish hype reflected in the expensive shares, has chosen to dump a mountain of the stock in recent weeks.
Mandalay has yet to provide any major details about the celebrated deal that sparked its powerful rally, allowing the hype to build -- and further bolster its handsome gains  ahead of a looming update.
With its stock rocketing to a multi-year high, Mandalay seems very tempted to carry out another dilutive secondary offering after practically doubling its share count over the course of the past year.

The Emperor noted that Allergan had the opportunity to purchase the business at a $27 million enterprise value but instead went with TARIS for $67.5 million, and it said that the company would also face competitive risks from Elmiron. The Emperor additionally said that due to stock promotion, a recent purchase by the Baker Bros. and a biotech bubble, Aquinox faced about 75% downside.","AQXP's stock explodes higher on enormous volume (10x float) on marginally positive news.

Analyzing the company's first 10-K in 1999 and comparing it to the latest 10-K, Bronte Capital found that capital requirements for the business had gone up 350 percent in the last 14 years, the workforce had become 20% less productive, and maintenance and management costs had gone up as well. He said it was ""on an operational level...seemingly the worst run mining operation the United States."" He did not have any explanation for its outsized financial success. On 3-14-2013, Bronte Capital compared capital costs to other mining companies and found that the company used both more machines and that those machines required more maintenance. On 3-20-2013, he went on to compare Alliance Resource to Patriot Coal, which was in ""a spectacular bankruptcy."" Hempton found that Patriot produced better, more expensive coal, though it had much larger compensation and post-retirement liabilities than Alliance Resource. Two days later, he said that the company is, at least relative to Patriot, ""extremely under-reserved for workers compensation."" Hempton said this was part of the reason the company ""appears so profitable relative to the competition."" On 3-28-2013, Bronte Capital concluded that the company's financial advantage must relate to favorable prices at which it sold its coal. He said this was likely either due to fixed price contracts that would likely soon expire, forcing the company into or near bankruptcy, or else that major accounting fraud was occurring.","It is also no secret that the coal mining industry in America is stretched. Very stretched. There are a bunch of reasons - but for thermal coal the main one is that coal fired power stations are closing - driven by two main factors:
1. Very low natural gas prices are making gas-generated electricity very cheap - cheaper than coal generated electricity in many cases and
2. High environmental costs (especially mercury amelioration) causing plants to close.                           Bluntly - the amount of capital employed here has risen enormously. The gross property, plant and equipment per ton of coal produced is now $67.87 - up a long way from $19.70 per ton.

The last 12 years in the US have not been a period of massive inflation - and the rise in capital intensity of this business is - well - surprising. The capital intensity of this business has gone up 345 percent. The capital employed per incremental ton of capacity is very large indeed.

Reuters said ION was also skeptical of the company's margin targets. On 10-15-2015, Market Folly reported on ION's presentation at the Sohn Conference. ION said that Altice was experiencing a boom and bust cycle, and ION also questioned whether Altice's management had utilized increasing capitalized expenses to inflate its HOT brand's EBITDA margins. ION said that when adjusted for capitalized content costs, HOT's margin improvement was negligible. ION additionally questioned Altices operating track record and its management's ability to retain subscribers, and ION added that industry headwinds threatened traditional pay-TV with the rise of alternative OTT players. ION said that Altice had overpaid for its pay-TV acquisitions and that Altice's cost-cutting targets were unrealistic, and ION also said that it was skeptical of the company's Cablevision synergy targets considering fiber competition, lack of a mobile offering, and rising content costs. It said that shares were worth about 50% less. On 12-2-2015, Ion Asset Management published an update to Seeking Alpha stating that Altice's Q3 reported results exposed additional aggressive accounting at the consolidated level. ION said that Altice's HOT subsidiary reported a 43% EBITDA margin in its IFRS Hebrew disclosures to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange but a 48% margin in Altice's consolidated results and corporate presentation, and ION said that Altice attempted to reconcile the discrepancy in saying that it had capitalized an additional 290 basis points of content costs. ION said that applying this explanation to the company's 2014 annual numbers resulted in the total level of content capitalization amounting to 31% of content costs, and ION said that Altice's questionable margin expansion undermined the company's achievements. ION also noted ongoing operating weakness in Israel and in its largest asset, Numericable-SFR in France, and ION questioned whether the company's cost-cutting had alienated customers. It set a price target of 10.00 per share.","Industry headwinds threaten traditional Pay-TV; We question whether HOTs real EBITDA margin has improved by

Einhorn said that athenahealth was one of several stocks in a ""bubble basket"" that Greenlight was shorting. Einhorn said ATHN could fall to $14/share, as it deserved the far lower multiples assigned to business process outsourcing companies, not those of ""true"" cloud companies. Einhorn also said a competitor, Epic Systems, was providing a far superior product and dominating athenahealth's market. Einhorn called CEO Jonathan Bush ""well-meaning and honest,"" but ""occasionally promotional.""","This is very much a work?in?
progress, and it is unclear whether athena will succeed in this segment. Lets get to the most eye?catching thing about all the bubble stocks  the stock chart. Of course, sell?side analysts are happy to fuel the fire.  Here is one, using pretty much every hot buzzword he can think of. We believe that these assumptions are quite aggressive and likely to prove too optimistic. And then without a word of explanation it plugs in a 30% EBIT margin assumption in 2030.
Morgan Stanleys predicted near?term EBIT ramp from about 10% today to 13% at the end of the decade is possible. 30% margins are not. And it is this assumption that drives the bulk of the DCF?derived value. Before everybody got lost in the clouds, athena was grouped with other financial and transaction processing companies.  These are good businesses, but they dont merit triple digit P/Es.

numerous documented allegations of and allusions to off-label marketing from purported employees, as well
as our recorded discussions with ex-AVNR employees. We believe AVNR will see its Nuedexta revenue
plummet and face over $100mm in fines and penalties following a potential government investigation. We believe that AVNR will lose its current patent case, and as a result, face an 80%+ decline in revenue and
default on its debt due to a clause which lists [a] commercial generic version of Nuedexta (for the treatment
of pseudobulbar affect) becomes available as an event of default. AVNRs capital structure will experience extreme pressure in the near future due to $20mm in upfront
required payments to OptiNose, $3mm/quarter in debt maturing starting in 2014, ~$1mm/quarter in revenue
loss from expiration of the US Abreva patents license next year, and $2-3mm/quarter in incremental expenses
related to the OptiNose deal. Even ignoring the off-label marketing and patent case issues, we believe
significant equity capital raises are necessary for AVNR within the next year in order to stay solvent. AVNR faces two major issues in selling Nuedexta on-label that have not been properly acknowledged by
Management or investors: lack of interest in prescribing drugs to treat PBA and competition from antidepressants (which we believe, based on published data, are superior to Nuedexta in terms of efficacy,
cost, efficiency, and safety). Based on our research, discussions with medical professionals, and discussions with ex-employees, we believe
the total pool of marketable PBA patients is at least 75% smaller than Management currently claims. ) AVNRs AVP-923 (dextromethorphan/quinidine compound) pipeline is irrelevant because AVNR lacks the
financial resources to complete clinical trials for any indications and has not found any partners.) We do not believe AVNR will be able to successfully monetize Nuedexta in the EU or the rest of the world for
a meaningful amount of revenue. We believe AVP-825 will be virtually unmarketablein
terms of efficacy, it is dominated by competitors and it requires a patient to blow dry powder into his/her
nose, making it, in our opinion, the least desirable way to administer sumatriptan",Legal Headwinds,Regulatory headwinds;Unsavory management;Weak or declining patent protection;Growth unsustainable;Debt default risk;Cash shortage;Product not as valuable as perceived;Major Business Fraud;Capital structure;Growth overstated;Strategy issues,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,"Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",Nasdaq,fy2013,1,GV_021776,"Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",IQ324406,Pharmaceuticals,-,55.259,75.366,-75.476,0,4.15,0.826,55.259,4.15,0,12.526,71.216,5.846,12.526,93.137,0,0.71,49.506,-5.502,71.844,0,-0.17,4.989,0,2.888,1.593,-71.427,-2.761,0,-4.046,0,0,-75.473,0,76.079,0,-65.422,5.876,-75.473,-0.449,0,0.003,0,7.943,-75.476,0,0,0,0,34.793,0,0,21.422,-75.476,0,0,0,-0.362,0,0,0,57.608,-75.476,0,0,-75.476,0,0.015,-0.53051,0,-500.536,-0.53051,0,0,142.2694,0,18.471,-0.53051,51.265,18.471,-0.53051,0,76.079,142.2694,0,-0.33156,0,-0.33156,41983,41547,-70.601,0,0,-70.601,51.265,152.06362,-14.519,(Invalid Formula 0me),-71.427,0.12147,-69.795,18.471,0.806,2.685,0.12147,-47.17063,0.003,29.365,0,0,7.943,NM,-37.13897,21.422,0,-35.17372,-25.894,4.098,-3.24516,47.836,0.003,-71.05,267,0,271

Now, lets move on to the insider buying that helped inspire so much confidence in AXDX ahead of that remarkable surge. But first, go back and look at the prices that those AXDX insiders actually paid for most of their stock in the company.

In it, Dialectic said Brookfield Asset Management Inc. was confusing and fascinating, with a network that expanded to nine public equities. Dialectic noted a series of inconsistencies in the company's reported earnings, particularly the impact that its stake in General Growth Properties (GGP) had on its earnings. (ValueWalk had previously reported that Dialectic had a short position on 5-21-2012, but little detail about the position was available at the time.)","One of the inconsistencies that Dialectic noted in BAMs quarterly earnings report was how Brookfield Asset Management Inc.(NYSE:BAM) (TSE:BAM.A) reported gains worth $1 billion from the acquisition of GGP, when the stock was basically flat after BAM acquired a stake in the company. At another time, BAM has claimed that the GGP stake was worth $12 billion to BAM, when GGPs total market cap is $16 billion (BAM owns 40 percent of GGP). This is where Dialectic ties the link between BAMs reluctance to a buyout of GGP by Simon Property Group, Inc. Dialectic suspects that Brookfield Asset Management Inc.(NYSE:BAM) (TSE:BAM.A) booked up its position in General Growth Properties Inc (NYSE:GGP), using some skilled IFRS accounting and are therefore are not accepting an offer below that mark. n the investor letter, Dialectic also tries to comprehend what went into General Growth Properties Inc (NYSE:GGP)s spin-off of Rouse Properties Inc (NYSE:RSE). Before the IPO, Brookfield Asset Management Inc.(NYSE:BAM) (TSE:BAM.A) owned 37 percent of RSE and later put up a rights offering at $15, which was above the market price. As rights offerings are usually below market price, BAM was able to contribute $170 million out of the total $200 million raised.

The company's cash balance had fallen below $2 million, and management disclosed it would not generate cash flow for the rest of the year. The company was also in non-compliance on at least $6 million of debt with Comerica Bank and had 19 trading days to meet a new deadline set by the bank. The company was offering $30 million in new equity, but Pearson suggested a plunging stock price would lower that amount. Pearson also noted a history of cash flow problems for the company, including four years without positive cash flow from operations except for one quarter the previous year.","The company missed analyst estimates by 2 cents and updated investors with guidance at the lower end of previously given ranges.As shown below, further steep declines in Biolase are highly likely in the next few days due to the need to issue a large amount of equity, regardless of the price. The only way for Biolase to repair the situation with its lender will be to issue a substantial amount of stock at whatever price the market will bear within the next 19 trading days. What we can see is that anything resembling an asset has already been given to the bank as security. There is nothing left to give. When assets ran out, Biolase began giving the bank warrants on its stock. Biolase has been in business for nearly 20 years but has consistently failed to generate profits.

After years of consistent losses, investors and analysts were cheered in March, when Biolase released Q4 results. In Q4 Biolase reported a rise in revenue and a very rare profit. The hope was that after decades, Biolase might finally be turning the corner. The shares rose to a multi year high of over $6.00, up from just $1.50 last year. Biolase is clearly hoping that its products are in fact superior to the degree it believes, and that as a result its lackluster sales growth thus far will be replaced by more impressive performance.",Overvalued by markets,cash shortage;debt default risk;Additional Equity offerings to fund company;capital structure;Recent rally;lackluster product and sales,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"BIOLASE, Inc.",Nasdaq,fy2013,1,GV_023291,"BIOLASE, Inc.",IQ349813,Health Care Equipment,NasdaqCM:BIOL,1.44,55.992,-11.482,0,34.9,0.601,1.44,34.9,0,11.042,21.092,1.965,11.127,28.059,0,11.378,4.029,0.264,25.854,0,-1.436,8.797,0,-0.999,1.826,-10.996,-0.061,0,-0.6,0,3.109,-11.646,0,31.038,0,-9.296,8.56,-11.646,-0.675,4.633,-0.164,0,0,-11.482,0,0,0,0,21.939,0,-0.01,0,-11.482,0,0,0,-0.685,0,0,35.1,22.557,-11.482,0,0,-11.482,35.1,0.038,-1.75201,-32.104,-123.75,-1.75201,0,-16.399,6.5536,-32.104,8.481,-1.75201,5.908,8.481,-1.75201,0,31.038,6.5536,0,-1.11065,0,-1.11065,42440,41639,-10.395,0,7.10977,-10.395,8.847,7.51892,-1.103,(Invalid Formula 0me),-10.996,1.19287,-9.295,5.372,1.1,0.22,0.75558,-7.27875,0.047,4.633,0,2.996,4.633,NM,-5.0835,0,0,-5.0845,3.193,0.599,0.093,13.114,-0.134,-11.07,220,-0.03,273

the retail stocks in our portfolio. The stock was down 17 per cent in February and, after
the company said this month that it expects profits to be flat this year (hardly a disaster),
has fallen further. The company has a market capitalisation of $1.65bn and, after
deducting year-end estimated cash of $380m, an enterprise value of $1.27bn. We expect
it to reach $380m in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation this
year, with free cash flow of about $190m. With the stock around $28, it trades at about
3.4 times ev/ebitda and 8.8 times free cash flow, for a cash flow yield of 11.3 per cent. We think a private buyer would pay double these multiples for this high-quality business.
While there are always competitive threats, we do not believe the book superstore
business is declining. We think Barnes & Noble can grow at a low- to mid-single digit
rate for several years  but at this price, we dont need any growth whatsoever for this to
be a successful investment.

The Street Sweeper quoted experts who called using fuel cells in cars ""extremely dumb"" and said the technology faced significant challenges to widespread adoption, which was decades away at best. The Street Sweeper argued that the potential deals left to sustain the company, like providing fuel cells for buses, was a ""very slow, low-rev process...with little financial impact.""","Fuel cell maker Ballard Power Systems (BLDP) has let its best technology slip away and insists on weaving down a long, bumpy road to nowhere on three flat tires.  But the fuel cell manufacturer would have been wiser to ink a deal to sell its customer, VW, all the fuel cells it wants. However, blinded by the cash infusion, the market excitedly ran up the stock by $1, though the deal was really worth only 38 cents per share ($50m/132m shares). Apple appears to be secretly working toward an Apple-branded electric car, according to the Wall Street Journal. Some clean stocks, like Ballards, ran up a bit while numerous reports circulated about Apple working toward an answer to rival Googles prototype self-driving electric car.

This excitement merely shows that the industry is moving toward electric vehicles over the next decade. Not fuel cells. The company thought it had knocked down a China bus deal worth approximately $6 million over the 2014-2015 period, Ballard trumpeted last June 19.

The Telecom Backup Power market is a key growth driver for our business and is also a significant opportunity in China given the scale of the market and Chinas growing focus on clean energy technology, said John Sheridan, Ballards former president and chief executive.

Ballard would be the exclusive supplier of subsystems to Chinas Azure Hydrogen, Ballard announced in various press releases.

The Street Sweeper also noted that Badger only held a $4 million cash position and said that the company additionally faced thin margins, bad weather and economic softness. It said that Badger would also see continuing inventory problems, fierce competition and poor flow-measuring technology demand for oil rigs during ongoing oil patch malaise.

In fact, the company blamed snow, a hurricane and city budget concerns for a 53.5 percent profit plunge early in 2013.

Second, the catch up Mr. Meeusen referred to revolves around inventory piling up in the Badger warehouse and about $6 million worth of potential sales idled.

Infitialis argued that future growth of Annie's was ""severely limited"" by capacity constraints on organic farming and that outsourcing all of the company's manufacturing and logistics exposed it to risk and uncertainty. Infitialis also believed that its product, apart from being organic, offered consumers roughly the same product as competitors but with an average 63% price markup. Infitialis also noted a failure by the company to successfully expand into either cereal or, its latest attempt, frozen pizza. Infitialis further stressed over $200 million in insider selling by management and Solera, a private equity firm that purchased the company back in 2002, since the company went public earlier in the year.","This connection may explain why BNNY was allowed to go public with such a tiny float and the fawning sell-side equity research provided by the underwriters after the pricing. the rest were insiders happily selling out at an effective price of $17.67/share after the underwriting discounts and commissions. The IPO transaction was clearly designed as liquidity event for Solera as net of offering fees and expenses. First, Annie's future product growth is severely limited by the current organic sourcing capacity constraints. Second, Annie's is only a couple of steps removed from its roots as a commune start-up relative to most NYSE-listed businesses. For example, the NYSE recently threatened to delist the Company for its failure to properly notify the NYSE and investors of its annual shareholder meeting as required by the exchange regulations. In addition, the Company has only 85 employees and only recently acquired an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system to institutionalize the business planning and internal controls. Annie's plans to hire aggressively (including sales, marketing, operations and finance teams), which significantly constrains any hopes for meaningful margin expansion due to increasing fixed costs. Annie's operational growing pains and managerial mistakes will likely continue into the future based on the limited track record of the management team and operating history as a public company. Based on this track record of trampling upon the rights of public shareholders, it appears there is a continued possibility for the significant divergence between the interests of Annie's insiders and public investors. this makes the business extremely susceptible to third-party shipment delays, excessive price fluctuations for inputs, and potential food safety issues.

regulatory change, mortgage REITs now have access to the same borrowing power, and will be
entering this space. Since
BOFI is paying some of the highest rates in the industry for CDs to build its deposit base, the
margins are razor thin and the risks are commensurately higher than a traditional bank. That turned out to be a profitable gamble, as the
credit markets have stabilized and interest rates have remained low. But that strategy is simply
not sustainable. Theres much more competition at every point in the credit market, and BOFI
simply cant make a higher-risk higher-reward bet than its competitors in this environment. The growth in accounts is not only slowing, its reversing.

Essentially, Kerrisdale said the business model the company had depended on would not meet with the same success in an era of rising interest rates and competitors that were duplicating its reduced expenses model. On 4-8-2014, Kerrisdale released its full report, saying the company was ""overexposed to interest-rate risk,"" would see its core net interest margin decline by as much as 40%, and faced an increase costs, reduction in fee income, and increase in competition across several aspects of its banking business."," But BOFIs margins have been inflated in recent years by well-timed purchases of
distressed securities, aggressive expansion in long-duration lending, and a drastic shift toward shortterm deposits.  As legacy securities roll off
and interest rates rise, BOFIs funding costs should increase far faster than its asset yields,
compressing its NIM by as much as 40% and crushing its ROE even more.

Real Talk Investments said that the BofI transcript had material additions/omissions versus the actual events on the call, including discussion on the OCC's investigation into Erhart's claims, the bank's largest deposit account and why the company switched external auditors.

On 11-4-2015, Real Talk Investments published a follow-up report noting that rather than publicly addressing transcript alterations, BofI had privately discussed them with at least one analyst, which it said had ramifications for the company's underwriters. Real Talk Investments also examined BofI's related party mortgage program and said that the company's assertion to the SEC regarding better collateral protection on insider loans was not accurate. It noted several related party loans to the company's management with very favorable terms and said that the company did not appear to be booking the below-market rates on its loans as ""other compensation."" Real Talk Investments said that the company's reputation was irreparably damaged and that its equity would become worthless.

On 11-5-2015, Real Talk Investments published a list of 12 questions ahead of BofI's 11-10-2015 analyst day, which it said that BofI needed to answer in order to regain credibility.

On 11-18-2015, Real Talk Investments said that BofI had employed a former felon for over five years in a senior role, with oversight over the banks mortgage operations, but Real Talk said that BofI had not filed a formal FDIC waiver. Real Talk added that BofI had made two loans to the executive after he had filed for bankruptcy, and Real Talk added that the company was in violation of Section 19 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act 12 U.S.C. 1829.

On 11-25-2015, Real Talk Investments said that despite continued public allegations claiming regulatory wrongdoing and potential accounting fraud, FBR & Co. continued to aggressively promote BofI's stock to its clients, and Real Talk said that FBR could face financial and reputational damages as a result of its underwriting relationship.

On 12-16-2015, Real Talk Investments said that Jonathan Ball's credibility was of critical importance in BofI's defense against fraud allegations, but Real Talk said that prior to his role with BofI, Ball ran internal audit at a bank that failed due to fraud and excessive growth. Real Talk questioned Ball's effectiveness in BofI's lead internal audit role, and it said that Ball's declaration in regards to the Erhart case should be viewed with skepticism.","I was shocked to discover that the BOFI Transcript differs substantially from the actual events that transpired on the call (Link to Webcast).

The Street Sweeper reported on rumors that the company was effectively bribing doctors, in violation of the law, to use their test over others. It also noted that the company had an outsize portion of its budget devoted to marketing, noting a sense of befuddlement by industry experts as to how the company regularly made such gains, even while other leaders of the industry stagnated. For the company's billing practices, The Street Sweeper said Medicaid auditors in New York had found an over 20% error rate. The Street Sweeper also shared stories of serious billing issues experienced by other companies that had worked with Bio-Reference Laboratories. The Street Sweeper further made the case that the company's main test, GenPap, was overly expensive and tracked a variety of diseases that were not applicable to the majority of women undergoing a pap smear. On 11-10-2011, The Street Sweeper released a second report, detailing the criminal backgrounds of several executives in senior management, their lucrative compensation packages, and the company's association with a variety of other ""shady characters."" The Street Sweeper specified that it was no longer short upon publication of its second report.","Nevertheless, Bio-Reference promotes GenPap as a valuable test for essentially all women and employs an aggressive nationwide sales force to court the doctors who take care of them. Although Bio-Reference has reported explosive growth in its young womens health division since launching GenPap, however, even some fans of the test question its suitability for such a broad swath of the female population. I use it selectively, says Dr. John Siegle, a veteran obstetrician/gynecologist who trains third-year residents in the field. Its very, very pricey and not really cost-effective for society. Together, they portrayed Bio-Reference as a company that relentlessly pushes excessive specialty tests  even bribing healthcare providers for their business -- and then routinely utilizes improper billing practices (such as upcoding and code stacking) in order to inflate the payments that it receives.  Bio-Reference ended its most recent quarter with a whopping 92 days' worth of sales outstanding (DSO)  a crucial metric used to gauge a companys financial health  that dwarfs the numbers reported by other players in its group. In the end, of course, Bio-Reference will never collect all of the unpaid receivables that sit aging on its books. Last year, for example, Bio-Reference wound up writing off the equivalent of 13.6% of its annual sales as bad-debt expense for outstanding claims that would most likely remain that way. Until the U.S. Securities and Exchange intervened, records indicate, Bio-Reference simply kept those numbers to itself. With the SEC repeatedly pressing Bio-Reference for concrete details about the revenue estimates contained in its last 10-K filing, however, the company finally released specific figures that exposed the full scope of that striking pattern.

Spruce Point said that ""when you strip-out the Wall Street buzz words du jour of 'social' and 'SaaS' from BV's business description...[Bazaarvoice] appears to be a pedestrian marketing analytics company."" Spruce Point argued that its data analytics and social commerce strategies could easily be matched by ""no less than 27 companies,"" if those companies wanted to compete in the same space. With a history of operating at a loss, several years before the company expected to earn a profit, a recent defensive and steeply priced acquisition of competitor PowerReviews, a business model that requires ""significant upfront investments in acquiring new clients,"" and upcoming insider selling, Spruce Point said the company's stock was significantly overvalued.On 7-2-2012, Spruce Point released a follow-up report, continuing to criticize the company's costly acquisition of PowerReviews. Spruce Point said synergies from the acquisition were unlikely and that PowerReviews customers were unlikely to pay Bazaarvoice's much higher premium for the same services. Spruce Point also noted a DOJ antitrust investigation that the company had disclosed. ","So what does this billion dollar company do? Bazaarvoice is a provider of social commerce solutions that
help clients capture, display and analyze online word-of-mouth, including consumer-generated ratings and
reviews, questions and answers, stories, recommendations, photographs, videos and other content about
their clients' brands, products or services. The company's solutions are provided via a SaaS platform to
clients in a range of industries including retail, consumer products, travel and leisure, technology, financial
services, healthcare and automotive industries.
Call me anti-social or just an extreme skeptic, but I struggle to justify BV's $1.1 billion enterprise value.
Since being founded in May 2005, the company has been unable to reach an EBITDA or cash flow positive
break-point, and is not projected to do so any time soon. When you strip-out the Wall Street buzz words du
jour of ""social"" and ""SaaS"" from BV's business description, you're left with what appears to be a pedestrian
marketing analytics company that may forever be challenged to achieve commercial success. Even the most
bullish Wall Street estimates have BV bleeding cash until 2014, which would mark a total of 9 years of
consecutive losses.
Of course, there's no guarantee that the company will ever achieve a profit, or a proven business model. A
major sticking point for potential customers appears to be their unwillingness to embrace BV's solution
such as Ratings & Reviews, due to the discomfort with displaying negative reviews about products or
services offered on their websites. Furthermore, policing fraudulent or inaccurate reviews presents a major
challenge.",Strategy,product commoditized;undifferentiated product;competitive pressures;not profitable;new prospective entrants,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Bazaarvoice, Inc.",Nasdaq,fy2012,1,GV_188157,"Bazaarvoice, Inc.",IQ25414219,Software,-,74.367,106.136,-24.329,50.834,37.416,2.108,125.201,37.416,0,17.977,68.72,7.71,17.977,70.169,0,0,21.266,-5.566,147.551,0,0,15.791,0,0.808,8.868,-22.715,13.432,0,0.017,0,0,-23.518,0,156.867,0,-0.32,2.523,-23.518,-5.119,0,0.811,0,0,-24.329,0,0,0,0,57.4,0,0,0,-24.329,-50.884,0,0.038,-56.253,0,0,0,63.269,-24.367,0,0,-24.367,0,0.006,-0.92289,0,-65.157,-0.92289,0,0,26.403,0,93.598,-0.92289,115.827,93.598,-0.92289,0,156.867,26.403,0,-0.55671,0,-0.55671,41816,41029,-20.607,0,58.51394,-20.607,115.905,60.87994,59.317,(Invalid Formula 0me),-22.715,1.59958,-18.907,93.598,1.7,0,1.59958,-14.69875,0.33,0,0,0,0,NM,6.69613,0,0,6.69613,-125.201,0,-15.194,93.598,1.117,-25.726,640,-0.306,180

Prescience said the company created a large reserve after the acquisition and was using that reserve along with other tricks ""to mask the negative financial impacts"" of poorly performing Shaw contracts. Prescience said that management had worked on ""generating as much in earnings as possible, regardless of quality,"" for their own financial ends. Because the company had no excess cash, a dependency on debt, and could ""be forced to write-down its grossly overstated goodwill"" or restate its financials, Prescience said it believed Chicago Bridge would face a debt default or else offer a ""dilutive"" equity offering to deal with its ""liquidity crisis."" The same day, the company directly responded in a press release, saying it ""strongly disagrees"" with the report. It stressed that Prescience Point would gain from any decline in the company's stock and confirmed its current guidance for the year. On 12-15-2014, Prescience Point said on Twitter that CBI had declined 50% as predicted and so Prescience Point had closed out its position.","Use of Creative Acquisition Accounting Conceals Financial Problems, Inflates Profitability: We believe by using creative
acquisition accounting, CBI inflated its 2013 gross margin by 27% and reported EBITDA and Adjusted EPS by 36% and 52%,

In a 59-page presentation, West Face Capital said Callidus had high portfolio concentration, limited disclosure on borrows, an unpredictable earnings stream, increasing leverage against its loan book, loans against illiquid collateral, a complicated portfolio to track, a troublesome underwriting record, and potential conflicts of interest with its largest shareholder. West Face said that if the stock traded at multiples similar to other business development companies, it would see a share price decline of 33%. The presentation was originally only distributed privately but became public as a result of a civil dispute between Catalyst Capital Group, the parent company of Callidus, and West Face over an employee who left Callidus for West Face. West Face would not confirm if it held a short position in the stock. On 10-2-2015, West Face announced that it was aware of a proposal from Newton Glassman, the executive chairman and CEO of Callidus Capital and the CEO of Catalyst Capital, to have a public debate about Callidus' prospects. West Face said that it was willing to participate in such a debate but noted that it had no interest in the success or otherwise of Callidus. West Face also said that it would be inadvisable for West Face to participate in such a debate while Glassman's litigation against West Face continued."," West Face alleges the quality of the Callidus loan portfolio is weak. Much of this is masked, says West Face, by limited disclosure on the part of Callidus or companies that Callidus lends to. Lastly, West Face says the portfolio is not well diversified meaning a few bad loans could have a big impact.

GeoInvesting said that Cadiz's main business project, a water relocation project in the Mojave Desert, was doomed for imminent failure, and GeoInvesting added that a 10-5-2015 letter from the California State Office of the Bureau of Land Management validated prior reports on the poor prospects of the water project. GeoInvesting further explained that Cadiz would not be able to package its water project via a ""railroad purpose"" loophole to avoid a likely unsuccessful federal review, and GeoInvesting said the likelihood of appealing this regulatory decision was very small. GeoInvesting said that Cadiz also faced an insolvent balance sheet and a massive liquidity crunch, as well as had posted a loss for the prior 42 quarters. GeoInvesting said that without steady profits, the company's shares were headed to $0 per share via bankruptcy, toxic debt, dilution or other means. On 10-26-2015, GeoInvesting said that equity in Cadiz was still 100% worthless and that the water project appeared to be subject to a federal review, which GeoInvesting said had an almost zero chance of approval. GeoInvesting added that in the interim, Cadiz was burning cash with major debt due early. GeoInvesting also said that even if the project was approved, Cadiz would have to pay a $5 million fee to the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California to have the water project reconsidered with no guarantee of approval. GeoInvesting also noted that a 10-13-2015 meeting of the Metropolitan Water Department confirmed the department was ""not pursing any negotiations or conversations at all."" On 11-6-2015, GeoInvesting said that major shareholders had decreased their stakes in Cadiz, including Odey Asset Management.
Later that day, GeoInvesting commented on Cadiz's earlier announcement of debt refinancing and said that the company was selling equity to pay down debt. GeoInvesting also said that it was unlikely that the company would be able to make a $9 million payment to its lender by expanding agricultural operations, as GeoInvesting said that the agricultural segment only generated slightly over $200K in the prior quarter. GeoInvesting added that after making its $9M payment, Cadiz would still have more than $100M in total debt obligations, which GeoInvesting said would require the issuance of about 26 million shares. GeoInvesting reiterated its $0 price target.

On 1-5-2016, GeoInvesting noted that a recent 8-K from Cadiz indicated that the company leased part of its farmable land for a one-time payment of $12M, with the remaining land an option for $43M. GeoInvesting said that cash raised had to be used to pay back secured lenders, which GeoInvesting said was the only way lenders and the company's large shareholders could avoid default, but GeoInvesting added that a conservative estimate on the sale of the remaining 30,000 acres of property would still put the company well short of being able to pay off their entire debt obligation. It reiterated that Cadiz was worth $0 and said that the companys remaining sole project was still seeing hang-ups.

On 1-22-2016, in its December newsletter, GeoInvesting said that new information it had learned since the publication of its earlier articles was consistent with its earlier conclusions about Cadiz.","A letter on October 5th from the California State Office of the Bureau of Land Management continues to paint a bleak picture for CDZIs focus  its ongoing water project.
This reconciles with, and further validates, past critical articles suggesting that the project is doomed for eventual failure and, as such, the company may be as well.
On top of its main business operation looking like an impossibility, CDZI faces a major liquidity crisis and has enormous debt coming due.
As it stands, CDZIs balance sheet is insolvent and the companys equity is worth $0 dollars on paper with seemingly no future road toward profitability or cash generation.

Pump Stopper said there were ""serious"" investor disclosure questions around the company's capital raise with Water Asset Management, exposing the company to possible lawsuits and bankruptcy. Pump Stopper concluded that, even if the project were feasible, the stock and project economics were overstated. Pump Stopper noted that insiders had collected tens of millions of dollars while significantly diluting the stock and losing the company hundreds of millions of dollars. Pump Stopper gave the stock a price target of $0.","Public BLM FOIA documents show Cadiz project already effectively failed with imminent NEPA federal review. Due to hidden appropriations dynamic and balance sheet, this means the project is impossible.

Even more concerning, serious CDZI investor disclosure questions arise with recent Water Asset Management capital raise, if lawsuits ensue, instant bankruptcy is a real possibility.

Governing authority MWD has definitively said theyve already made the determination and dont see how it can be built while also indicating subsidy impossibility.

Even ignoring impossible hurdles above, CDZI stock is over valued and project economics overstated. With cash burn, minimal revenue, project unviability and $106m of debt maturing soon, bankruptcy is inevitable.

Because Ikarian Point believed Celgene gave millions in charity to the CDF, which in turn sometimes helped patients pay expensive co-pays to purchase Celgene's drugs, Ikarian Point said Celgene's revenues could be hurt if the CDF were no longer around to assist with co-pays. Ikarian Point postulated that ""if CELG donated $86 million or more to the CDF in 2012 then such donations likely drove as much as $860m worth of CELG's total revenues."" While Ikarian acknowledged there were other charities that it could divert charity dollars to if the CDF folded, it said those charities were much smaller.","A week later, on its Q3 earnings call, QCOR announced that the, 'USAO [US Attorney's Office] for the Southern District of New York and the Los Angeles Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission are also participating in the ongoing investigation by the USAO in Philadelphia,' which has been investigating the promotional practices of QCOR since September 2012. Another event which occurred in the last few weeks and which we find very unlikely to be a coincidence is that the Founder, Chairman and President of the Chronic Disease Fund, Michael Banigan, has stepped down from his post at the CDF. Michael Banigan is no longer on the Leadership page nor is he the Chairman or a Trustee of the Board. We find it curious that just as the CDF is receiving a large amount of scrutiny it hires a Chairman well versed in lawsuits of all kinds. Maybe they are getting ready to deflect future legal problems. Further, we highlight the fact that the entire CDF Board has turned over. In 2012 the Board consisted of seven people: Michael Banigan, Al Henry, Jay Arbetter, Kenneth Brown, Steven Block, Mike Scholten and Joel Fineberg. Not one of those people is currently on the Board. Banigan, Henry, Arbetter, Block and Scholten had been on the board for over five years. In our view, this is not a coincidence. The CDF has been exposed and they appear to be covering their backs. This may potentially produce large problems for one of the CDF's largest donors: Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG).If the CDF were to shut down or curtail its operations significantly it would be a big problem for CELG because the CDF's copay assistance program drives a large proportion of CELG's revenues.Without the increased utilization of copay assistance programs like those provided by the CDF we estimate 2012 price increases for CELG would have been nil and total revenues would have been $720 million lower.

Citing the recent political unrest over a change in party leaders, Bronte argued that populist sentiment against the privileged Chinese political class would depress sales, making the wealthy less interested in flashing around half million dollar watches. Bronte noted that sales had been mixed at the company since a record year in 2011.","Sales growth stopped. However exports to Hong Kong kept up (note that 21.2 percent figure above). 

The volume growth actually went negative - being negative 3.4 and 3.1 percent for the last two months.

What do you do with an inventory glut of hundred thousand dollar watches. You can't really discount them - so they just sit there, looking a little stale and slowly devaluing your brand.

And that is why I am short the stock. It is a trading short really - this company is likely to miss earnings and it will miss it in an unfortunate way - they are going to be swamped with inventory.
This changes the stakes and it is structural. A half million dollar watch no longer says ""look at me"". It says ""look at me, I am a kleptocrat"".

Shareholder Watchdog said the company's earnings were poised to take a massive hit once government regulations limiting automatic overdraft were implemented in July and with potential further regulations to come under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Further, Shareholder Watchdog noted that CHCO traded at 200% of its book value, one of the highest multiples of all U.S. banks. It estimated 45% downside.","City Holding Company (NASDAQ: CHCO) of West Virginia is a bank that is perhaps the most egregious perpetrator of a nasty trick being played on US retail depositors. We do not believe it is an exaggeration to describe CHCO as a glorified payday lender operating under the umbrella of a bank charter. We believe the stock will face significant earnings and multiple compression, and believe current investors face greater than 40% downside from current levels. CHCO not only tops the lists of overdraft fee generators, but does so by a wide margin. By our estimate, City Holdings generates 60% to 70% of earnings from overdraft (see table 2 below).we can only assume that CHCO is using the most aggressive and potentially deceptive tactics in the industry to promote overdraft. First, starting on July 1,2010, a new Federal Reserve regulation (known as Reg E) goes into effect that significantly alters overdraft fees. First, we see significant earnings risk that investors have ignored, so far. Analysts and investors appear to be assuming that future monthly maintenance fees will offset the gaping hole that would be created from the reduced overdraft fees. We believe this will be very difficult for CHCO to implement because overdraft fees are primarily generated by a very small percentage of depositors. The second driver for the lower stock price will be multiple contraction. As investors begin to understand the risk to CHCOs primary income driver, the multiple on these destabilizing earnings stream will also contract.",Legal Headwinds,Aggressive accounting;Accounting misrepresentation;Growth unsustainable;Regulatory headwinds;business model pressure;High earnings multiple,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,City Holding Company,Nasdaq,fy2010,1,GV_016781,City Holding Company,IQ261215,Regional Banks,NasdaqGS:CHCO,66.379,136.134,38.96,0,0,5.075,68.495,0,0,0,136.134,0.83,0,62.016,0,9.3,0,0.705,85.059,0,0,131.479,0,0,64.53,62.599,0,456.285,0,0,56.573,57.413,0,2637.295,0,68.333,2171.375,57.413,-5.045,114.826,18.453,0,0,38.96,0,0,0,0,2286.201,0,0,16.495,38.96,57.976,0,0.237,-32.143,0,0,0,2322.434,38.723,0,0,38.723,0,46.249,2.484,-6.005,270.905,2.484,-0.078,-102.853,15.589,-6.083,314.861,2.47,0.236,314.861,2.47,-12.902,2637.295,15.651,0,2.30182,0,2.2927,41353,40543,0,-21.35,15.50478,0,-32.446,15.37445,3.744,(Invalid Formula 0me),0,20.30735,0,258.288,0,28.5,16.6586,35.88313,15,131.321,0,-6.083,114.826,32.1408,0,16.495,54.7997,0,62.826,0.658,0,0,19.688,0,805,-1.235,39

Citron noted that the company had already been targeted by the Department of Justice in a case that accused the company of over-enrolling patients in critical care services because costs are much higher. Citron said this new case, unsealed on 5-6-2013, was a whistleblower suit joined by the government that accused the company of falsely certifying patients in its VITAX subsidiary of being eligible for hospice care. According to the lawsuit, normal hospice certification requires patients to be terminal within six months, while the company's average patient lived two years and seven months in hospice care. Citron said the company would ultimately experience a decline in its business, as it had to follow regulations much more stringently, along with any damages it experienced. Citron also said the company's other major subsidiary, Roto Rooter, which accounted for approximately 26% of the company's revenue, was also facing significant problems. Citron criticized the company for not formally disclosing the lawsuit as a material event.","On May 2, the US Department of Justice filed a false claims act lawsuit alleging fraudulent billing in
 Chemeds VITAS business units in appx. 20 states. Enrolling patients in hospice who are not in fact at end-of-life, then billing and collecting for
services not provided, or services provided to patients who dont need them and dont qualify
 for them  while encouraging employees to lie about the patients condition, and failing to train employees in proper patient qualifications for enrollment in hospice care.
2. Enrolling hospice patients in critical care categories, allowing them to bill dramatically larger
 daily amounts (up to 8 hours of daily in-home nursing care, meant for extreme medical crises)
 This windfall revenue is based on falsified patient categorizations, pushed by corporate demands that management maintain quotas of such patient statuses.   The increased scrutiny will force the company to carefully certify each hospice enrollee, which will
reduce its intake rates and therefore reduce its revenues.

Pump Stopper found the legality of several parts of this arrangement suspicious and warned that the company could all but collapse with ""the threat of regulation, devastating fines, and an unraveling of their business,"" along with possible recession in South America, where much of its international business took place. Pump Stopper also said the ""low quality"" company's valuation was ""sky-high"" and saw 88% downside to the stock.","Citizens Inc. is a low-quality life insurance company trading at sky-high valuations of 66X P/E and 4.5x Price/Tangible Book, yet faces multiple total wipeout risks.

CIA sells insurance overseas without a foreign presence with questionable legality - while a questionable ""Stock Investment Plan"" artificially generates temporary demand inflating CIA's stock.

When foreign insurance regulators wake up, there could be huge fines that could completely wipe CIA out - Brazil fined peer company NWLI $6 billion.

CIA has -75% to -88% downside just to trade at a similar valuation as superior peer company NWLI. Multiple additional risks create potential for -100% overnight loss and total wipeout.

The economies of CIA's largest end-markets in South America are imploding, creating serious macro headwinds for CIA. Additionally, in recent years, CIA appears to be relying on these high-interest loans to pad its anemic earnings. CIA insiders have collected an absolutely shocking $29.1m (so far) in total compensation (per CapIQ) since 1998. CEO Harold E.

Shkreli also said that the company's developing anatabine nutraceutical and pharmaceuticals business was worthless because it was highly unlikely that nicotine and anatabine had different properties beyond those already known. He also questioned the company's management and the viability of an appeal on a safer tobacco production patent case that Star Scientific had filed against R.J. Reynolds. He noted that he believed the stock may remain overvalued for some time and that fair value of all shares was 90%+ less than current prices.
","The final piece of analysis isare anatabine nutraceutical and pharmaceuticals worth anything?

My opinion is a conclusive no. The chemical structure of anatabine is a demethylated nicotine.

It is highly unlikely that nicotine and anatabine have different properties. Nicotine has interesting properties in vitro and in vivo, but the millions, if not billions of users of nicotine know exactly what its properties are. It is highly unlikely anatabine and nicotine have beneficial properties beyond those already known. It is known that these agents are ligands for nicotine receptors, which have been implicated in Alzheimers. Nevertheless, clinical trials by Comentis, Memory/Roche and Targacept have revealed these products to not be meaningful pharmaceutical agents. Stars lack of success in nutraceuticals bodes poorly for their new endeavor. Their complete lack of experience in pharmaceuticals makes it unlikely the company will succeed there.

The Street Sweeper said the company's revenue peaked a decade ago, that its product was unpopular, and that a lawsuit against R.J. Reynolds (RAI) would go nowhere. In the second part of its report released a few days later, The Street Sweeper detailed a series of legal troubles the CEO had encountered during his career and analyzed the repeated rise and fall of the company's stock as it waged its legal battle with R.J. Reynolds.
","For years, corporate filings reveal, Star has enjoyed far more success selling its story (and the stock it keeps issuing in order to stay afloat) than it has at actually selling its unpopular products. Star executed the latest in a series of private placements during the first quarter of this year, with enough warrants and stock options now outstanding  at average exercise prices of around $2 a share  to increase the companys swelling share count, which totaled less than 60 million back in 2000, by another 33% to almost 180 million shares. The restrictions on the last of that cheap stock should expire this September, records indicate, with the shares facing a potential slide toward $3 unless the companys handsome market value further expands to absorb that looming dilution hit.

Of course, that price assumes that investors continue to value Star based on its ambitious plans and keep ignoring the companys miserable results.

Berry said knowledge about using flames and electric fields was as much as 200 years old. As the company had no near term plans for revenue, Berry questioned the credibility of management and the company's researchers, and criticized the company for not having its technology tested by a third party. On 10-17-2012, Matt Berry questioned the claims the company made in connection to who precisely had worked on its leading technology. Calling its technology a ""science scam,"" Berry doubted the involvement of the company's listed inventors and said it was doing everything it could to associate itself with the University of Washington. On 2-4-2013, Berry said that the company had lied to the SEC and had omitted material facts, among other issues, and was ""legally vulnerable"" for these reasons.

On 2-7-2013, Matt Berry said that ""Clearsign has lied about the business and science experience of the Chief Science Officer"" and wondered, if the company was lying about its inventor, ""how is it possible to have a technology without an inventor?""
","he technology of applying electric fields to flames is not new. In fact experiments were first performed about 200 years ago.Does Clearsign really have a unique technology? It certainly appears that it wants us to believe that it does. We are reminded that it is actually a discovery company. It has no marketable products. In his LinkedIn Bio, he refers to his role there as ""Director of Patents at Microvision."" It appears that Mr. Wiklof's job during and after Rutkowski's tenure at Microvision is to help build patent portfolios. Other than his work on Clearsign's patent applications, I have found nothing in his history which shows a series of experiences leading up to a groundbreaking advance in the science of combustion.So, we will focus on the scientists here, the ones who introduced Clearsign technology through the currently pending patent applications, the ideas of which were first filed in April 2009.

Thomas S. Hartwick, besides being listed as an inventor on the patent application, is also listed at the top of the ""Technical Advisors"" found in the Prospectus.

The Street Sweeper said the company had taken on $570 million in debt and that a new pivot to the low margin and fiercely competitive generic natural gas distributor/reseller business would be a difficult change. The Street Sweeper said the company's revenues were bolstered by one-time events and concluded that oil prices, a disinterest in liquefied natural gas, and the company's margins and debt would turn the company ""into a wreck. "" The Street Sweeper gave the stock 60% downside.","CLNEs expired tax credits and a one-time gain added artificial value to revenue and EBITDA, according to analysis of recent earnings. The upcoming financial report will likely disappoint, too.

Cheaper diesel makes natural gas less attractive, particularly to big fuel-guzzlers such as long-haul trucks.

CLNE bets long-haul diesel trucks will switch to LNG. But planned LNG engines are on hold, LNG plants have been shut down, and 5% NG adoption predictions now appear overblown.

CLNE is over half-a-billion dollars in debt, even as it feels pressured to continue building out fueling stations to honor commitments to customers. While Clean has had some wins, the future doesn't look too inviting. Experts say a 5 percent penetration of natural gas heavy-duty trucks anticipated in 2015 is too optimistic. Truck drivers and fleets aren't turning to tractors fueled by natural gas at anything near the extent projected just two years ago.

Infitialis said the company had ""no business to speak of"" and an ""unimaginable valuation of $400 million."" Infitialis was also critical of the company's intended acquisition of Masterpiece Investments, which it said was of uncertain value, had a CEO with an extensive criminal background, and had received a $300,000 loan from a man under litigation with the SEC over running a Ponzi scheme. Infitialis was also suspicious of a Canadian firm, Mercator Associates, and that firm's involvement in selling shares at a large mark-up to retail investors while using shady legal loopholes.","After investigating for several weeks and conducting extensive background checks on the principals we discovered that the CEO and founder of the company merging into CLSR has a serious criminal background having been convicted in the 1980s and early 1990s for ""Counterfeiting US Currency"" and ""Building and Detonating Explosives"". The CEO, Mark Ghighlieri (who now appears to be an art dealer and also goes by the name of Marco Selvaggia) has spent hard-time in jail for crimes that are so serious they are unheard of even for the OTCBB world. While we are still scratching our heads as to how security regulators and gatekeepers have let this slip, Mr. Ghiglieri has been busy promoting the shares of CLSR to a valuation which is now approaching $400 million. As with all pump and dumps there are nearly 12 million undisclosed shares that were secretly purchased for $.004 a share (less than half of one penny) and are being sold into the unsuspecting retail investor at $5.50 a share through a little known broker in Toronto, Canada.

GeoInvesting said the company's app had been accused of manipulating users and prompting them to uninstall third party browsers, including Google Chrome, from their mobile phones. Without the Google Play ranking, GeoInvesting said the company's flagship app could cost considerably more to push out to new customers to sustain its mobile growth. GeoInvesting said Cheetah had a valuation significantly higher than its ""well-entrenched larger competitor, Qihoo 360 Technology"" and argued that Cheetah's stock should fall in comparison.

On 8-7-2014, GeoInvesting said in an interview that Cheetah's app was again listed on Google Play rankings. GeoInvesting criticized the company for disclosing the event to investors in China but not in the United States.
On 9-8-2014, GeoInvesting was quoted in a story by Bloomberg saying Cheetah Mobile would ""see some serious headwinds in the future."" According to story, GeoInvesting co-founder Dan David held his short position through a personal account.

On 10-9-2014, GeoInvesting was quoted in a Bloomberg article saying that Cheetah Mobile's Clean Master app was ""redundant"" for both smart phones and the PC. The Bloomberg article said CMCM was ""the most shorted stock in the U.S.""","CMCMs flagship Clean Master app was removed from Google Plays top free app rankings, calling into question growth in its highly touted large overseas user base and future monetization potential.

Outside of China, daily downloads from Google Play of CMCMs six apps have fallen by approximately 88% following Googles removal of Clean Master from the rankings.

Management has not alerted investors to these negative developments that occurred since July 15, 2014, raising a significant corporate governance issue.

There is a risk that the Clean Master app may be kicked out of the Google Play store if violations of store policies are not mitigated and resolved.

Given the current undisclosed significant business risk, CMCMs current valuation premium over QIHU is entirely unwarranted and we believe the stock is worth between $7.00 and $9.00.",Product ineffective,Strategy issues;lackluster product and sales;Deceptive Marketing;Growth unsustainable;Failure to disclose material adverse information;Unsavory management;Insider selling;Product commoditized;business model pressure,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,Cheetah Mobile Inc.,NYSE,fy2014,0,GV_020128,Cheetah Mobile Inc.,IQ253748612,Software,NYSE:CMCM,1093.285,1858.182,68.317,513.621,329.089,79.631,1606.906,329.089,8.304,303.917,1529.093,173.771,375.587,876.424,0,0,443.214,-157.605,2093.545,0,0,88.583,0,33.325,45.905,100.97,29.7,338.842,28.221,-7.33,461.302,128.432,0,3001.175,-29.232,359.222,88.96,99.2,-36.561,0,27.895,0.1,0,71.305,-196.57,0,0,0,621.656,0,-145.108,0,68.317,-737.424,0,4.148,-1109.623,76.531,0,0,718.306,64.169,0,0,64.169,0,0.222,0.5301,0,142.76,0.5301,0,0,121.0501,0,2206.338,0.50917,1409.179,2282.869,0.50917,0,3001.175,134.17325,0,0.63843,0,0.57599,42851,42004,180.601,0,0,174.537,1313.567,142.39019,561.287,(Invalid Formula 0me),100.97,16.2769,333.332,1745.036,152.731,0,12.87372,77.282,21.427,0,0,0,0,28.1199,184.13425,0,0,184.13425,-1606.906,0,-49.295,2282.869,14.989,144.04,1809,12.906,423

The report cited past medical study results and highlighted the fact that the company was rolling out public stock offerings just before clinical trial results were due to be released. Street Sweeper also outlined company director and majority shareholder Lindsay Rosenwald's track record of failed biotech companies, predicting that Coronado would meet the same result.","In fact, the results were so bad that over a dozen patients stopped gulping down their worm egg drinks before the study ended.This bleeding company with a highly debatable product in fact quietly filed this new shelf registration after market close July 12.

This represents tremendous dilution and overhang for a company with a market cap of about $234 million. Since CNDO execs seem to have serious doubts about their therapeutic candidates usefulness, they want to grab that money now. We believe the company has to do this now so it will be able to find and buy other therapeutic candidates before investors lose their confidence in the company. Rosenwald and Interneuron president Dr. Glenn Cooper were individually named in one class action lawsuit that focused on allegations of misrepresented facts about the drug.

Copperfield said if Conn's sold its portfolio (as management had said it may do) but failed to retain underwriting and servicing, Conn's' business model was likely broken, given a lack of autonomy over credit creation. Copperfield said that Conn's had ""disingenuously 'window dressed' its credit portfolio, while subtly removing important disclosures from investor presentations.""","Today, the most important variable in the Conn's story is whether the company can successfully monetize the credit portfolio and negotiate a flow agreement. The word ""and"" is paramount in this discussion because a sale of the credit portfolio, without a flow agreement that allows Conn's to continue underwriting loose credit, destroys Conn's retail economics.Based on our analysis, we believe Conn's has disingenuously ""window dressed"" its credit portfolio, while subtly removing important disclosures from investor presentations. Despite wide ranging sell-side analysis of Conn's, the most important picture - cumulative loss curves - has somehow managed to escape scrutiny. Significant uncertainty persists on where credit losses and ultimate cumulative losses on recent vintages will normalize. Our presentation of cumulative loss curves is in direct conflict with the widely held view by retail sector investors and sell-side analysts that management's underwriting changes are driving credit improvements. When viewed through a credit portfolio lens, it is clear that the exact opposite is happening - losses are accelerating.A litany of regulatory issues (both present and future) would seem to present a material deterrent to prospective portfolio buyers. Just last week, the CFPB moved to regulate installment lenders, which will likely subject Conn's to much earlier than expected CFPB regulation.The class action lawsuit alleges that Conn's top two executives ""possessed the motive to commit fraud [when they] reaped more than $4.5 million in insider trading proceeds.""

Sure enough, the next day CorMedix held the earnings call and filed a registration statement clearing shareholders to sell $19 million worth of stock.

So, 75 stockholders can soon sell 2.45 million dilutive shares on the public market.

A stunning 47 have thrown up their hands and said Were outta here while the getting out is good. They intend to sell every single share. Former company director Gary Gelbfish and his entities buck off ~96,000 shares, pushing ownership from 6.6 percent down to 6.5.

Current director Matthew Duffy holds percentage steady but offers nearly 5,000 shares for sale.Competition is heavy in this area, according to the physician. Twitter and message boards contain comments about the possibility of a company buying out CorMedix.

And CEO Randy Milby has stated that CorMedix is looking for strategic alternatives. The market ran the stock up like crazy, under the interpretation that CorMedix is for sale.

But, along with other pressing financial issues, CorMedix is in the midst of suing German company TauraPharm in Germany District Court, alleging patent infringement and, in a second complaint, unfair competition related to the catheter lock solution.

On 9-11-2013, Alpha Exposure said a recent report by Northland Capital Markets giving the company an Outperform rating was largely copied from a 2011 report by the same company and used overoptimistic models.","CVD's low tech margin profile is not surprising if you consider that CVD spends virtually nothing on R&D. Not surprisingly, with so little spent on R&D, CVD does not have a substantial patent portfolio. With miniscule resources and capabilities, the notion that CVV is on the cutting edge of graphene technology development is laughable. In addition, a recent WSJ article (here) states that large multi-billion dollar companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and BASF (OTCQX:BASFY) are investing heavy resources into developing graphene applications and filing thousands of patents all related to graphene. The notion that CVD can compete with companies like these is preposterous.However, those large orders were tied to a thin film solar customer and have since dried up. Thin film solar is a dying technology, and CVD has said that orders are unlikely to be repeated from this customer. Since mid-2011, orders have declined year over year for 8 straight quarters and averaged under 0.7x Book-to-Bill.Most alarmingly, while CVV has promised new orders over and over again, their backlog has fallen to desperate levels.In the meantime, CVD is barely breakeven and cash flow from operations has been negative for 3 straight quarters.",Overvalued by markets,Weak or declining patent protection;lackluster product and sales;business model pressure;Competitive headwinds;Growth overstated;Cash shortage;Ineffective management/staff,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,CVD Equipment Corporation,Nasdaq,fy2013,1,GV_002581,CVD Equipment Corporation,IQ257184,Semiconductor Equipment,NasdaqCM:CVV,11.24756,17.88393,-0.56032,0,11.17389,0.63899,11.24756,11.17389,0,4.46141,6.71003,0.4612,4.46141,7.10408,0,4.49735,1.01316,2.70875,21.89588,0,-1.75444,19.63248,0,-0.41999,15.62028,-2.68855,-0.35389,0,-0.13381,0,0.05501,-2.82763,0,39.14164,0.8709,-1.06734,0.46807,-1.95673,-2.07156,0,-1.39641,3.6199,0.72,-0.56032,0,0,0,0,3.45186,0,0,4.56551,-0.56032,0,0,0,1.55518,0,0,0,8.01737,-0.56032,0,0,-0.56032,0,0.06092,-0.09229,0,9.53598,-0.09229,-3.03733,0,6.07138,-3.03733,31.12427,-0.09229,0.07574,31.12427,-0.09229,0,39.14164,6.07138,0,-0.29108,0,-0.29108,42094,41639,-2.04957,0,6.09171,-2.04957,-2.9616,6.09171,-2.47376,(Invalid Formula 0me),-2.68855,5.10929,0,31.06927,0,0.16374,5.10026,-1.76727,3.00E-05,5.28551,0,-3.03733,0.72,NM,-3.34812,4.56551,0,-3.24578,-5.96205,0.16374,0.6015,36.40978,0,-4.12112,169,-1.39641,285

Infitialis said that whistleblower allegations documented in a Massachusetts Federal Court lawsuit by former employee Andrew Hagerty would expose Cyberonics fraudulent practices and coercive sales tactics. Infitialis also noted that insider sold $34 million of stock in 2012.","This is the first time these allegations and this lawsuit are being disclosed to the investing public, as the company failed to do so even as the original complaint was filed on August 8, 2012 -- well within the disclosure period of the last 10Q. CYBX trades at an extremely high multiple of 41 times trailing 12 months net income of $36 million. Even when looking to 2013-2014 projected earnings, CYBX is still very expensive at 34x and 30x earnings respectively. When compared to peers such as Medtronic (MDT) and St. Jude Medical (STJ), which trade at an average multiple of 12x, CYBX trades at a premium of more than 240%. Adding insult to injury, CYBX quarterly revenues total in the millions, while (MDT) and (STJ) quarterly revenues total in the billions.It's imperative to remember that these already weak results were produced on the rarest subset of the epilepsy population (refractory epilepsy), which affects a total of 250,000 people, as opposed to the general epilepsy population, which is numbered in the millions and which the company and Wall Street analysts tout as their target market in their regulatory filings. Thus, it is our belief that VNS will never be viewed as a legitimate treatment for depression, as the scientific data has proven its lack of efficacy. This is yet another argument in favor of the asymmetry to the downside in the valuation of CYBX, as most market participants believe the company is about to embark on this new frontier and have already factored that prediction into the valuation.But what the Cyberonics sales team lacks in formal medical education they make up with steak house dinners and fine wine (further documented in Part III), while they voraciously pitch surgeons on implanting as many VNS devices as possible in their respective sales areas.

Shkreli added that there was no clinical evidence to suggest that Cytori's autologous adipose cell therapy would work, and he suggested that the company should do a large study with definitive results. He also criticized Cytori's first U.S. study, ""ATHENA,"" for its small sample size, and he noted that data would not be available until late 2013 or early 2014. He also criticized Cytori's ""ADVANCE"" study for its meaningless primary endpoint. He said that Baxter and Mesoblast were pursuing ""real"" endpoints in comparison, and he said that Cytori had attempted to benefit from its association with regenerative medicine but was actually behind other cardiovascular and stem cell therapy leaders. Shkreli added that the company was in poor financial condition and predicted the stock would decrease by half in the next six to 12 months due to flat revenues and the lack of definitive data.","My second issue with Cytori is their focus on cardiovascular stem cell therapies is particularly limiting when one's goal is to be a leader. Autologous adipose (fat) cell therapy is Cytori's strategy. The concept is simple: fat contains stem cells. Take the fat from a patient and centrifuge and filter to the point where it is pure in stem cells. Take this solution and administer it to the site of action where the patient might need stem cells. This all sort of makes sense, but there are a number of fatal flaws. The first is there no evidence to suggest it works. Despite some diehard faith from Cytori investors and seemingly, management, there is limited clinical proof of concept for Cytori's approach.

Lakewood also said that it expected insurers and pharmacy benefit managers to target Diplomat with cost containment efforts, which Lakewood said could cause the company to miss out on business. Lakewood added that Diplomat faced a considerable headwind as Gilead's Hepatitis C drug sales began to decline and as the addressable population slowly disappeared, and it said that the company would struggle to show any meaningful organic growth.","nvestors and analysts who blindly assume that Diplomat can organically grow its top and bottom line annually by 20% to 30% are bound to be disappointed. In fact, we wouldnt be surprised if the company struggles to show any meaningful organic growth in the coming year.

Davis said that DAVIDsTEA wanted to open hundreds of new locations in Class A shopping malls throughout the U.S., but she said that Teavana, a rival tea retailer owned by Starbucks, had already entered 200 out of the estimated 265 high-end shopping malls.

Davis also said that just half of the company's 10 directors were classified as independent and that only two of the company's executives actually worked in the U.S. She said that given these challenges, company insiders might unload stock once a ""lockup"" period expired.","A Canadian retailer with ambitious plans to take the U.S. market by storm, DTEA has adopted the same kind of strategy that almost bankrupted its co-founder's first company.

With its new Canadian stores cannibalizing sales at its older locations, DTEA has decided to bet its future on a risky U.S. expansion plan that could easily backfire.

Despite the weak performance of its U.S. stores to date, DTEA wants to open hundreds of new locations in Class A shopping malls all over the country.

That goal seems wildly optimistic, however, since a rival tea retailer  owned by the formidable Starbucks beverage chain  has already entered most of the country's high-end shopping malls.

Given the challenges that DTEA faces, company insiders might feel tempted to start unloading mountains of stock once a temporary lockup period expires just a few short weeks from now. Insider sales: DTEA insiders stand to make a bundle, whether the company ever makes it in the U.S. or not. Currently restricted from selling a mountain of stock that has lost a big chunk of its original value, DTEA insiders will soon face a tempting opportunity to start cashing in their shares when a so-called ""lockup"" period expires - suddenly freeing three-quarters of the company's outstanding shares for sale - just a few short weeks from now. Some of those lucky insiders have already jumped at the chance to strike it rich, in fact, and walked away from the company's recent IPO as multimillionaires. Even the former CEO and COO, sent packing with nice severance packages the previous year, managed to hit seven-figure jackpots.  Unlike its SEC filings, however, the non-offering prospectus that DTEA filed in Canada discloses a pesky detail that Toutant might have understandably preferred to conceal: Together with DTEA Chairman Pierre Michaud, the CEO presided over a mysterious company that filed for bankruptcy just a few months before he took over as the newly appointed leader of the retail chain.

According to Pearson, ZM Funds, Erickson's controlling shareholder, benefitted immensely from Erickson's purchase of Evergreen, a ""deeply distressed"" helicopter operator that was in default on its debt and the defendant in multiple lawsuits prior to its purchase. He also said the company was over-levered, with hundreds of millions in debt and just $1.3 million in cash. Pearson claimed that Erickson compensated for this by touting a non-GAAP ""adjusted EBITDA"" to give optimistic but misleading results of its financial performance."," ZM simply had Erickson, the company that it controls, borrow $400 million in debtand a $100 million credit facility to buy the crippled and indebted Evergreen. Prior to the borrowing, Erickson was down to just $1 million in cash and already had $100 million in debt, so this represents a very substantial levering-up.ZM quickly began liquidating its shares in Erickson and has just filed to sell 100% of its entire stake in Erickson.The company has put a positive spin on the deal, noting that it will increase revenues, along with adjusted EBITDA.As soon as it was completed, ZM quickly sold millions in stock. And now, 2 days ago, a massive S3 registration statement was filed in which ZM will sell 100% of its remaining shares even as the ink on the deal is still drying. The S3 notes that after the offering, ZM will hold zero shares.

The report was offered to Seeking Alpha PRO subscribers only. Davis also said she did not have a short position.

On 8-4-2015, Melissa Davis followed up with another report, saying that Ebix's mysterious past still haunted the company. She noted the company had yet to resolve SEC and DOJ probes, had been murky on details over an IRS settlement and had never explained certain offshore transactions by its foreign subsidiaries. She also pointed out the CFO's recent efforts to seek employment elsewhere.
On 2-16-2016, Melissa Davis said that Ebix had yet to officially test, let alone launch, the new e-trading platform that Ebix had said was supposed to start generating ""substantial revenue"" at the beginning of 2016. Davis said that Ebix had fallen behind schedule on the project because it had to face demands for a ""complete rebuild"" of its outdated platform. Davis added that Ebix continued to wait for a formal contract that outlined the financial terms of its deal with Private Placement Limited, a year after Ebix had landed the deal.","Ebix should have never bragged about making tremendous progress in the crucial areas of employee retention and corporate transparency.

In recent months, the companys own CFO has openly shared his desire to start working at a firm with strong corporate governance and ethical values, if he can.

With Ebix on a tear earlier this year, the CFO and the longtime executives who oversee the firms mysterious foreign subsidiaries all slashed their stakes in the company, too.

That insider-selling spree followed welcome news of a long-awaited IRS settlement that prompted the companys sole analyst to arrive at a reassuring conclusion that seems like a stretch.

The Street Sweeper criticized the company's opaque structure, ""dinky auditing firm"" and confusing foreign subsidiaries, giving investors little comfort as to the real state of the company's operations. The Street Sweeper also said it was likely that SEC and DOJ investigations into the company would move forward. On 3-30-2015, The Street Sweeper released a second and longer report, questioning the value of company's goodwill and suggesting that the company was booking ""far more generous gains"" from its acquisition targets than was potentially warranted."," Ebix must pay the IRS a whole lot more than the company would like to admit.Almost certainly. While Ebix has convinced its sole analyst that it simply owes back taxes on the profits generated by one of the firms that it acquired between 2008 and 2012, the company never even purchased a firm capable of making enough money to result in such a hefty tax bill during that five-year period. Excluding generous additions to its liability reserve for the gigantic IRS bill that it now owes, Ebix has barely earmarked any money for routine income taxes at all.  Has Ebix found some way to artificially inflate its reported earnings, too?

Our conclusion: Yes. When Ebix acquires a company, it typically offers the firm some kind of earn-out payment if it manages to hit lofty financial targets that always seem to lie conveniently out of reach. Even so, Ebix automatically books those earn-out payments as future liabilities that it later reverses back into its reported profits when its acquisition targets invariably fall short of its ambitious goals. If those government agencies know even half as much as we do  and we highly suspect that they probably know a whole lot more  we wouldnt be surprised if they decide to crack down on both Ebix and its CEO once they finish investigating company. Now that another 18 months have passed since Ebix first encountered that question, however, were hoping that the company has finally come up with some kind of explanation that might actually make a little sense.While Ebix indicated that the parent company initially loaned the money to an Australian subsidiary, which in turn transferred the loan (along with the asset supposedly purchased with those funds) to its Singapore subsidiary, the financial statements for those foreign subs seem to rule out that possibility. That convoluted arrangement makes no legitimate business sense, anyway. Despite its modest size, Ebix literally operates about twice as many subsidiaries as Google (Nasdaq: GOOG), Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) and Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL) combined. Ebix conducts very little, if any, business in some of the countries where it has established foreign subsidiaries, too. By creating so many subsidiaries with so many different sets of books, Ebix has basically made its business a whole lot more complicated than it really needs to be. How can Ebix possibly expect its dinky auditing firm to verify the accuracy of its consolidated financial statements long before its foreign auditors even complete their own reviews?

Our conclusion: Ebix knows thats impossible, and it doesnt really care.

Two clients resumed shipments but the third customer is now not interested, according to EMAN. Heres EMANs link mentioning the highly competitive industry. Uh-oh, institutional investors appear to be discovering EMANs negatives, too. Its always a good idea for average investors to be on the alert if more institutional holders are selling a stock than buying it. Institutional holders that dumped their EMAN shares as of March 31 include Robert W. Baird & Co. and Deutsche Bank.

Altogether, 16 institutions unloaded some or all of their holdings for a total of 100,873 shares sold, pretty close to double the number going the opposite direction.

Not a good sign. And that unfortunate selling trend may link to more unsettling reality  revenue slips.",Overvalued by markets,Customer retention issues;lackluster sales;Competitive headwinds;Growth unsustainable;Recent rally,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,eMagin Corporation,NYSE MKT,fy2015,1,GV_114698,eMagin Corporation,IQ527181,Electrical parts,AMEX:EMAN,9.273,25.142,-4.105,0,18.164,1.53,9.273,18.164,0,4.953,6.978,0.606,4.953,6.687,0,3.901,4.353,-0.366,18.616,0,-0.567,18.468,0,0.764,9.131,-4.062,0,0,-0.043,0,0.243,-4.105,0,28.083,0,-1.261,1.636,-4.105,-1.189,0,0,0,0,-4.105,0,0,0,0,4.677,0,0,0,-4.105,0.75,0,0,-0.439,0,0,0,4.677,-4.105,0,0,-4.105,0,0.03,-0.16228,0,-210.938,-0.16228,0,-0.5,25.29604,0,23.406,-0.16228,5.833,23.406,-0.16228,0,28.083,25.29604,0,-0.10142,0,-0.10142,42979,42369,-2.532,0,29.3881,-2.532,5.683,29.3881,3.983,(Invalid Formula 0me),-4.062,0.79644,-1.632,23.163,0.9,0.013,0.78818,-2.56563,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1.05163,0,0,-1.02475,-9.273,0,-0.567,23.406,0,-3.721,87,0,630

Alpha Exposure said the company misrepresented the quality of current tests, particularly the FIT and InSure Fit tests, by using outdated studies and fudging numbers. Alpha Exposure said the test was significantly more expensive than alternatives, while being less effective, and that it would have a hard time getting reimbursement from CMS and insurance companies. Further, Alpha Exposure contended that the complication involved in administering the take-home Cologuard test would prevent doctors from giving it to anyone other than young, high risk males, a very small percentage of all patients that get tested for colorectal cancer. Alpha Exposure calculated that if the Cologuard test were used by 50% of eligible young men that actually went through with testing, the company would have $20 million revenues for a then $840 million market cap company. Finally, Alpha Exposure said this product would be the third failed test by the company, demonstrating a history of hype and promises that did not pan out. Throughout, Alpha Exposure said the company was intentionally misleading investors on the likelihood of success for its Cologuard test","Cologuard Is Actually Less Effective And More Expensive Than FIT.

However, there were instances of lower local reimbursement amounts, and Cable Car said it filed an FOIA request for other public comments.

On 1-23-2015, Cable Car Capital said it sent the CMS a reconsideration request over the Cologuard reimbursement rate for 2015.

On 3-23-2015, Cable Car Capital said it the CMS had disregarded cost-effectiveness concerns over Cologuard reimbursement on its own rather than due to other public comments. Capital Car also explained an additional statistical point found in one of the public comments that supported the lower reimbursement rate. On 7-19-2015, Cable Car Capital posted its reconsideration request presentation it gave at the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule Public Meeting on 7-16-2015, recommending that Cologuard be given a lower reimbursement rate. The same day, Cable Car Capital released an update on the panel discussion and noted that cost concerns were not discussed by panel members. Cable Car Capital urged the CMS to take all information into consideration when making its final determination.

On 9-25-2015, the CMS issued a preliminary determination maintaining the current reimbursement rate for Cologuard. A day later, Cable Car Capital released a response to the decision.On 10-23-2015, Cable Car Capital said that it had submitted a final public comment advancing a new, compromise crosswalk proposal for the Center for Medicare's consideration. Cable Car added that KRAS should not be included in the crosswalk but that it appeared Exact Sciences was ""going to get away with its clever exploitation of policy."" Cable Car also said that it no longer held a position in shares of Exact Sciences.On 10-31-2015, in a letter to investors, Cable Car said that it had covered its short position in mid-October after three years of varying degrees of involvement.

Gravity said the company was assuming CMS would reimburse for the Cologuard test based on the cost of the component parts. Instead, Gravity believed CMS would use a cost-effectiveness approach for pricing, which would price the test considerably lower than the company would need it to be at to turn a profit. Gravity also said adoption by patients and the size of the market were much lower than predicted by the company.","CMS will reimburse EXAS 70-80% less for Cologuard than EXAS has told investors. This will leave EXAS with negative gross margins-- making Cologuard unsellable.

EXAS' projected ~$500 reimbursement rate relies on CMS using a crosswalk analysis that calculates reimbursement based on cost of the components of the test.

Instead, CMS will use a gap-fill process relying on cost-effectiveness data. Our model shows reimbursement of $100-$150/test, and CMS publications show that a test dominating Cologuard was cost-effective at $179-$247/test. Soon after the FDA decision (potentially even the same day), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (""CMS"") will announce its preliminary National Coverage Determination (""NCD"") for Cologuard. We believe the eventual CMS national reimbursement limit for Cologuard will be below EXAS' gross cost per test - effectively making Cologuard unsellable for EXAS.To put it bluntly, we believe that following FDA approval, EXAS will be unable to sell its Cologuard test at a gross profit.

Kerrisdale said Sourcefire's upsell opportunity was becoming saturated and that new product introductions would increase competitive pressure. Kerrisdale said equity research analysts were awarding Sourcefire valuation multiples that were too high. Kerrisdale also said that the recent CEO appointment and industry precedent (as well as the stock's high price) suggested that Sourcefire was not a near-term acquisition target, despite such a suggestion from equity research analysts. Kerrisdale said that FIRE's valuation disconnect could be partially attributed to non-GAAP earnings, which overstated GAAP earnings by 400% because of several expense add-backs, including stock-based compensation.","Next-Generation Firewalls Could Replace 50% of IPS Deployments by 2015. As the
creator of the open-source Snort software, Sourcefire is deservedly praised for creating
one of the industrys most influential IPS products. But when it comes to mindshare in
the firewall market, Sourcefire fails to even earn a mention in Gartners Enterprise
Firewall Magic Quadrant. This should be concerning to FIRE investors because industry
pundits believe that next-generation firewall technology, which combines the features of
both traditional firewalls and IPS systems, will subsume 50% of IPS deployments by
2015. Admittedly, some customers may continue to prefer a multi-layer approach as
opposed to all-in-one NGFWs, but the threat to standalone IPS will only grow in time.
Even after launching its own version of an NGFW in Q4 2011, Sourcefires founder,
Marty Roesch, admits that FIRE still approaches customers with an IPS-first mindset, I
think the way people are approaching is that we typically interact with, you see them
starting up with IPS deployments and then turning on license keys to bring the additional
functionality to bear where necessary (FIRE Q3 2012 Call). While this strategy plays to
FIREs strengths, and allows them to avoid head-to-head competition with Palo Alto
(PANW), Check Point, Fortinet, and other NGFW leaders, it could be a losing strategy
over the long term.
 Slowing New Customer Adds and Saturation of the Upsell Opportunity will make
Growth More Challenging in 2013. Sourcefire has attempted to mitigate the threat from
competitive NGFW systems by launching two new products, a Sourcefire-branded
NGFW and the FireAMP Anti-Malware tool. After paying the upfront hardware,
subscription, and maintenance costs associated with a Sourcefire IPS, customers can
add NGFW and Anti-Malware software for a combined 30% price increase. The addition
of these tools to FIREs portfolio in late 2011/early 2012 allowed Sourcefire to grow
quarterly revenue by an impressive 51% (year-over-year) in Q1 2012. Since then,
however, upsell opportunities appear increasingly sparse, as YoY revenue growth
slowed to 27% in Q4 2012. Many have overlooked this slowing quarterly growth, instead
citing FIREs 35% revenue growth in 2012. Yet recent data in FIREs 10-K reveals that
Sourcefire only added 452 new customers in 2012, which is precisely the same amount
of customers adds as in 2011. This may indicate that 2012s growth reacceleration was
the result of one-off upsell opportunities, not increased customer wins.
 A Management-case DCF Model Yields a Fair Value of FIRE of $17 - $26, a 60%
Decrease from the Current Share Price. Since GAAP profitability continues to shrink,
Sourcefire utilized a February 25th Investor Presentation to remind shareholders of its
long-term margin goals. FIRE argues that, as the business expands, it can materially
decrease R&D, selling & marketing, and G&A expense as a percentage of revenue. This
Kerrisdale Capital Management, LLC | 1212 Avenue of the Americas, 3rd Floor | New York, NY 10036 | Tel: 212.792.7999 | Fax: 212.531.6153 5
long-term plan would theoretically add around 1000bps to FIREs 2012 operating
margin. While these long-term goals are praiseworthy, in practice they could be difficult
to achieve. Given the more than dozen competitors in both IPS and Firewall, FIRE must
perpetually invest in new research just to stay competitive. As for the selling & marketing
expense, Sourcefires shift towards adding channel partners should pressure margins
during the transition period, as shown by the 200bps increase in S&M expense between
2010 and 2012. But even if we overlook these challenges and assume that FIREs EBIT
margins consistently expand, reaching managements long-term goals by 2017, a
discounted cash flow analysis yields a fair value of only $20/share. This analysis uses a
10% cost of capital and a 3% long-term growth rate, both reasonable assumptions given
FIREs share price volatility and the growing threat from NGFW. Further sensitizing this
range to a 9%  11% WACC and a 2%  4% long-term growth rate produces a fair value
range of $17 - $26/share, or about 60% below FIREs current share price of $51.04.
 Recent CEO Appointment and Industry Precedent Suggest that Sourcefire is not a
Near-Term Acquisition Target. When traditional valuation metrics fail, analysts have
turned to valuing Sourcefire as a buyout target. For example, last years initiating
coverage report from FBN Securities (1/12/12) assigns a 50% probability to FIRE getting
acquired in the next few years as part of its valuation analysis. Assumptions like this
are reckless. To begin with, the April 10th appointment of John Becker at CEO, replacing
Marty Roesch who served in an interim role, reduced the odds of a near-term takeover.
If FIRE had been in back door negotiations for a sale of the company, it wouldnt be
necessary to grant Mr. Becker a 400,000 share restricted stock and option package that
would partially accelerate on a change of control. Secondly, a survey through precedent
network security deals reveals that many have already passed over Sourcefire in favor
of other platform acquisitions. IBM (IBM) acquired Internet Security Systems in August
2006, HP (HPQ) acquired TippingPoint via the 3Com deal in November 2009, Intel
(INTC) bought McAfee in April 2010, and Dell (DELL) paid $1.2bn for SonicWall in March
2012. The two firms most cited as acquirers, Cisco (CSCO) and Juniper (JNPR), already
market in-house, highly-ranked next-generation firewall systems. Finally, the Israelibased
Check Point agreed to acquire FIRE in 2005 only to have the deal blocked by the
U.S. government on security grounds. At 21% of 2012 revenue, the federal government
is by far Sourcefires largest customer and has its IPS systems installed throughout its
official networks. The government is extremely interested in ensuring FIRE remains
domestically controlled. Because of this, the possibility of an acquisition by a foreign
buyer is effectively nil while national security risks would complicate a transaction with a
U.S. buyer, especially one that has interests abroad. These reasons, in addition to
Sourcefires high 6.8x LTM revenue multiple, make us believe that a near-term takeout is
unlikely at the current share price.
 Wall Street Research is Drastically Overstating Sourcefires Addressable Market
Opportunity. By combining the firewall with the IPS, next-generation firewalls can
consolidate hardware and software tools into one platform, eliminating the need to
purchase separate IPS and firewall hardware. Since upfront product expenses are
Kerrisdale Capital Management, LLC | 1212 Avenue of the Americas, 3rd Floor | New York, NY 10036 | Tel: 212.792.7999 | Fax: 212.531.6153 6
typically the lions share of a vendors income, the cost savings to customers are
meaningful. But when viewed from the perspective of the vendors, such as Sourcefire,
this innovation might lower the revenue opportunity. This can be demonstrated by
Sourcefires new sales model, where customers need only pay 30% more to add NGFW
and Anti-Malware software to FIREs traditional IPS system. And because FIRE is an
IPS-first business, we believe Sourcefires ability to upsell NGFW and Anti-Malware is
primarily limited to existing IPS users. If this is the case, we can calculate FIREs
addressable market by multiplying the size of the IPS market ($1.2bn) by the
incremental upsell opportunity (130%), yielding a TAM of $1.5bn. Since Gartners market
size data only tracks product revenue, and not service revenue, it makes sense to gross
this figure up to $2.5bn (product revenue is 60% of FIREs total). Lastly, if we then apply
Gartners prediction that 50% of standalone IPS will convert to NGFW, then FIREs
addressable market would be just $1.25bn, or about 25% less than FIREs current
market capitalization. Comparatively, many analysts mistakenly believe that FIREs TAM
is between $5 -10bn (Topeka, FBN, Wells Fargo, and others). Without this enormous
addressable market opportunity, many of the valuation arguments made to justify FIREs
2013 GAAP P/E of 200x+ quickly fall apart.
 FIREs Valuation Disconnect can be Partially Attributed to Non-GAAP Earnings,
which Overstate GAAP Earnings by 400%. Any investor that takes the time to
scrutinize Sourcefires 10-K would quickly conclude that not only is FIREs business
barely profitable but its GAAP earnings actually fell in 2012. Diluted earnings per share
shrunk from $0.21/share in 2011 to just $0.16/share in 2012. But this is of little concern
to Wall Street research analysts, who instead value Sourcefire using adjusted
earnings. Driven by the exclusion of stock-based compensation, Sourcefires adjusted
earnings per share grew from $0.57 in 2011 to $0.81 in 2012. Realizing that SBC
expense seems to be considered free in the research community, Sourcefires
management appears to be actively shifting cash salaries into equity-linked
compensation. Even as revenue grows, SBC as a percentage of revenue has doubled
since 2008, growing from 6% in 2008 to 12% in 2012. These adjustments have allowed
FIRE to show steady year-over-year adjusted earnings growth when underlying earnings
have actually decreased since 2010. This tactic has buttressed FIRE shares over the
short-term, but we believe the continued degradation of FIREs quality of earnings
should be a clear red flag to any potential investor.",Competitve Headwinds,digital disruption;product not as valuable as perceived,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Sourcefire, Inc.",Nasdaq,fy2013,1,GV_176556,"Sourcefire, Inc.",IQ1709163,Systems Software,-,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,(Invalid Formula 0me),0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,297

Kerrisdale said same-store sales growth was ""anemic,"" and the company was likely to meet stiff competition from burgeoning growth at Dollar General (DG), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Family Dollar (FDO), and small-format Walmart (WMT) stores. Kerrisdale said the company's valuation assumed substantial margin expansion, particularly difficult for discount retailers, and an expansive growth across the business that was unlikely.

On 6-17-2014, Kerrisdale said in a follow-up report that many factors stood in the way of Five Below experiencing the rapid growth it had in years past. Among them were the possibility of copycat stores, failing to track fickle trends in the teen and pre-teen markets, increasing operational complexity from compounding growth, a decrease in quality markets to expand into, and struggling to cope with having already attained peak growth at a large percentage of its store base. Kerrisdale went on to discuss several examples of other retail stores that grew rapidly but failed to meet expectations.

On 6-30-2014, Kerrisdale released its third report on Five Below, saying that brick-and-mortar businesses faced a ""paradigm shift towards consumers shopping more online"" and that the company's future growth also faced that ""increasing threat.""

On 7-15-2014, Kerrisdale said in a fourth report that recent steep falls in the stocks of Container Store Group (TCS) and Potbelly (PBPB) were prime examples of specialty retailers that suffered a ""precipitous drop"" after an earnings or expected earnings miss.  Kerrisdale said FIVE had the same ""positive sentiment on emerging retailers"" that would ""quickly deteriorate after small hiccups, leading to significant valuation declines."" Kerrisdale said it was short TCS and long PBPB.","Its valuation multiples of 3x+ LTM revenue and 25x LTM EBITDA are far too high for a company with mediocre same-store sales growth operating in the brutally competitive discount segment of the retail industry.  Same-store sales growth (SSSG) has declined dramatically over the past three years, with SSSG for Q4 2013 falling to an anemic 0.4% and overall forward year guidance projected to be a modest 4%. Additionally, we expect the companys long-term margins to be pressured by the wave of competition flooding the discount retail sector, whether it be due to the 5% to 7% annual unit expansion of Dollar General, Dollar Tree or Family Dollar, or the 2,000+ Walmart Express small-format stores expected to open over the next five years; additionally, discount retailers rarely boast impressive profit margins due to their lack of brand name products. Finally, FIVEs catalogue is biased towards trendy/fad items that are targeted for a fickle teenage demographic and its sales are disproportionately weighted towards the holiday season, factors which both translate to increased volatility in year-to-year results.",Competitve Headwinds,lackluster sales;Bubble industry;Competitive headwinds;Growth overstated;Growth unsustainable;Ineffective management/staff;Operational inefficiency;business model pressure,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,"Five Below, Inc.",Nasdaq,fy2014,1,GV_171141,"Five Below, Inc.",IQ11464323,Specialty Stores,NasdaqGS:FIVE,50.184,535.402,32.142,0,347.386,13.469,50.184,347.386,0,0,188.016,10.092,0,119.779,0,89.377,0,0,160.899,13.5,-28.546,114.378,0,4.083,70.381,54.737,0,0,-1.513,-2.537,0,52.224,0,232.054,-0.266,31.187,34.013,51.958,-25.931,0,19.816,0,19.5,32.142,0,0,0,0,79.742,0,0,0,32.142,0,0,0.465,-25.931,0,0,0,115.181,31.677,0,0,31.677,0,0.542,0.59437,0,-168.291,0.59437,-15,0,53.29481,-15,116.873,0.59,1.632,116.873,0.59,0,232.054,53.74186,0,0.61244,0,0.60735,42453,41671,68.206,0,54.19072,68.206,-11.153,54.1939,-5.897,(Invalid Formula 0me),54.737,2.1567,110.006,116.873,41.8,1.259,2.1567,32.64,25.039,19.5,4,-15,19.5,38.1384,0.233,0,0,1.17863,-30.684,0,30.662,136.373,24.89,42.275,1000,-5.074,437

The report alleged that Fleetmatics had used aggressive accounting to inflate its profitability and pointed to weaknesses in the company's internal controls. Prescience Point also highlighted the fact that Fleetmatics insiders had sold off their entire stake in four public offerings during one year.","We believe shares of Fleetmatics Group PLC (NYSE:FLTX) are grossly overvalued, reflecting few, if any, of the serious risks that warrant questioning the credibility of the company's financial statements. In this report, we discuss the company's use of various accounting shenanigans that inflate profitability, the material weaknesses in its internal controls, the inexplicable discrepancies between related accounts in its financials, and Fleetmatics' founding backer's ties to a previous accounting fraud. According to our analysis, Fleetmatics' 2012 gross margin was inflated by 400bps and reported Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS were overstated by 27% and 33%, respectively. Going forward, we believe the company faces many headwinds, with its vehicle churn rate set to continue accelerating in 2H'13 and beyond; as churn picks up, FLTX is forced to accelerate its deferred costs, potentially resulting in both a revenue and a margin contraction problem, at the same time. We believe the company has presented itself to the investing public in a highly questionable manner and that, as a result, it has been successful in its efforts to inflate its stock price beyond any reasonable measure of valuation, enabling its insiders to cash out big before the cards come tumbling down. he industry is rapidly crowding with competitors and price has become the primary lever for closing new business.

He further examined the relationship between Francescas and its supplier that, according to Pearson, provided the company with unsustainable, non-market prices. Since that relationship no longer held, he predicted the companys previously stellar margins and exceptional growth would fall into line with the rest of the industry.","Following last quarter, management had hoped that aggressive promotions and discounting were coming to an end.

- Discounts were offered on all merchandise both via internet and in-stores.With the majority of merchandise on sale and for the majority of days of the quarter, it now becomes mathematically impossible for Francesca's results to deliver the ""less than 10% Secret Sauce"" as described by JPMorgan.

The Friendly Bear criticized sell-side analysts, who were distracting investors from poor performance at the company and the relatively low value of other pet food companies. The Friendly Bear said the company's recent velocity improvements could be misleading and were a distraction from a possible decline in fridge growth and anticipated problems with incremental margins. The report was posted on 4-6-2015 to Seeking Alpha's pro section and became public on 4-7-2015. On 4-29-2015, The Friendly Bear said it had found ""a number of complaints"" of consumers finding mold in their Freshpet products. The Friendly Bear visited 10 stores on its own and found 3 stores selling moldy products.","Freshpet has now admitted to having mold in some of its products, but management claimed that its ""fresh"" food is naturally susceptible to mold.

We question whether the ""fresh"" product designation is applicable for Freshpet given its average product shelf life is reported to be 140 days (7-10x longer than milk).

The company attributed mold to bags being compromised during transit and stocking - if this is true, we wonder why the company has not pulled defective bags from retail shelves.

We found precedents of other pet food companies issuing recalls as a result of excess moisture in packaging leading to the potential for mold growth.

Given the confirmation and (in our view) questionable explanation of mold, we see 75%+ downside (1.5x 2015 sales, a ~25% discount to pet food comps).

Bronte noted that the main advantage of First Solar's thin-film was cost, which Bronte said was driven by the fact that the product's semiconductor component used considerably less amounts of expensive ingot than wafers, but Bronte said that the price of semiconductor ingot had fallen. It added that a competitor, Applied Materials, Inc., had developed wire saws for cutting wafers 80 microns thick, which Bronte said required much less semiconductor in the wafer business, and Bronte also said that Applied Materials had developed a silicon semiconductor for much larger panels than First Solar.

On 4-15-2010, Bronte responded to criticisms of its earlier assertions and said that at low silicon prices, First Solar would become non-competitive. Bronte said that the company would see long-term margins per watt of the cost for Chinese manufacturers plus 10 cents per watt, which Bronte said would result in earnings falling sharply up to a silicon price of about $40 per kg. Bronte also said that if silicon prices fell as low as $20 per kg, then Chinese polysilicon makers would be more cost-competitive and First Solar's share price would go below $10 per share, but Bronte said that it no longer thought the polysilicon price would reach $20 because marginal players would face substantially higher costs. Bronte also said that it was unlikely that First Solar could increase its efficiency to yield lower cost-per-watt, and it said that cost-per-watt would fall faster for Chinese silicon manufacturers due to more opportunities for manufacturing improvement.

On 4-30-2010, Bronte said that c-Si cells were becoming cheaper to produce and that First Solar needed to address competitors with much lower cost structures, and Bronte also said that First Solar was behind schedule in improving its conversion efficiency to meet its cost-saving target. Bronte also said that it was incorrect in its earlier thesis that the Chinese c-Si producers were competitive and that over time the price of modules would decrease through normal competitive pressure to near the cost of c-Si cells, as Bronte noted that competition had not squeezed margins due to massive German demand for panels to be installed by the end of Q2. Bronte also said that were Chinese manufacturers to reach the costs on which First Solar's guidance was based, then First Solar's profit would crash if the company had to match the Chinese prices.","The competition came in a couple of forms. We are trying to work out the cost-structures of the polycrystalline manufacturers  but it looks
to us that the extra glass and other balance of system costs that First Solar panels have are
getting close now to completely removing the advantage of low semiconductor material usage.
If that happens though, First Solar is toast. It probably wont file bankruptcy because it has so
much in past profits to fall back on  but it will be every bit as obsolete as a Palm organiser is
now or a Garmin car navigation system might be in five years.",Product ineffective,Product ineffective;Competitive headwinds;business model pressure;Growth unsustainable,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"First Solar, Inc.",Nasdaq,fy2010,1,GV_175404,"First Solar, Inc.",IQ4593731,Semiconductors,NasdaqGS:FSLR,765.689,2563.515,664.201,167.889,1378.669,156.093,933.578,1378.669,10.969,307.019,1184.846,99.622,307.019,319.804,0,200.442,94.797,-91.773,1584.46,0,-69.68,1794.094,0,17.854,1430.789,750.803,0,180.271,14.369,74.83,433.662,760.381,0,4380.403,1.696,705.492,82.312,762.077,-588.914,0,97.876,0,26.826,664.201,-296.496,0,0,0,469.677,0,0,210.804,664.201,123.43,0,0,-742.085,0,-1.9,0,925.458,664.201,100,0,664.201,100,0.086,7.82416,0,1665.564,7.82416,-27.879,0,84.891,-27.879,3454.945,7.68,9.379,3454.945,7.68,0,4380.403,86.491,0,5.59822,0,5.49465,41332,40543,906.896,0,85.84351,906.896,150.451,85.89508,101.19,(Invalid Formula 0me),750.803,40.24701,923.196,3021.283,16.3,7.61,35.19524,475.23813,80.064,237.63,0,72.121,26.826,12.8433,128.36413,210.804,0,128.36788,-695.948,0,7.685,3692.575,155.916,317.982,6100,-58.04,42

That customer was under a long-term contract which expired in April, jamming 20% of revenues for Flotek into a single month, which will not be repeated.

The report disputed the number of Intelligent Media Kiosks actually operating and said FAB was offering minimum guarantees to franchisees of the kiosks. It also accused FAB of illegally providing pirated US movies through its Intelligent Media Kiosks in China.On 11-19-2013, Alfred Little published a report containing evidence that FAB had taken steps to actively cover up its pirated movie business. Also on 11-19-2013, GeoInvesting said it sent the prospectus of the questioned bond offering to regulators.On 12-16-2013, Alfred Little said FAB failed to provide adequate information for investors to verify the existence of its kiosks, that FAB did guarantee a minimum return on franchisees' kiosks, and that FAB had failed to acknowledge its removal of pirated content from kiosks.","Contrary to FAB's anti-piracy claims, FAB's ""Intelligent Media Kiosks"" are in reality loaded with very obviously pirated U.S. movies.
FAB's kiosk manufacturers acknowledged that: a) They historically supplied around 1,600-1,700 kiosks to FAB, only 10% of the 16,820 units FAB claims to have deployed; b) One kiosk supplier helped FAB stage phony manufacturer site visits for FAB's investors, reminiscent of the China Integrated Energy (OTC:CBEH) fraud I exposed in 2011.
FAB's director of franchisee sales acknowledged that: a) FAB has only around 1000 kiosks in Beijing (compared to 3,954 disclosed in the 6/1/12 proxy); and b) FAB promises kiosk franchisees guaranteed minimum returns on their investments and offers to buy back the franchised kiosks using FAB U.S. listed common stock. Based on the interviews and evidence that I collected, I conclude that FAB's business in China is a tiny fraction of what it claims in its SEC filings. FAB's actual profitability would be reduced even further if the company upgraded its pirated content to properly licensed content (assuming that is even possible).

GEF struggles from a leveraged acquisition spree where it acquired 40 companies for $1.2 billion. GEF appears to be obfuscating its financial performance to forestall a dividend cut.

It has had accounting issues; E&Y dismissed it as a client, and Deloitte, its new auditor, said it had material weaknesses in its financial controls.

GEF is trying to convince analysts/investors it can execute a turnaround. However, history shows that it has repeatedly failed to hit any of its financial objectives going back 14 years.

Moreover, he said many of these patients would have symptoms mild enough to be treated by cheaper drugs and alternative therapies. Pearson also detailed Synageva management's sell-off of over 95% of its holdings as evidence of imminent problems for the company.","Summary

Investors and analysts have overestimated the market size for SBC-102 by at least 3-9x.

Most sufferers of CESD can be treated by proper diet and common statins (i.e. Lipitor) without the need for a $300,000 drug.

Management has now sold 95% of its stock, reducing combined holdings to less than 1% of outstanding  even before their drug has completed trials.

Chanos said ""the PR mess"" surrounding Healthcare.gov could ""reduce the likelihood of future government contracts"" for CGI.","Among them are decreasing cash flow  a key metric of financial health  and falling bookings of new business, as well as various accounting conventions that have improved CGIs earnings, in part through recognizing revenue already counted by Logica plc, a big technology company CGI bought last year.Citing what he termed the PR mess surrounding its work on Healthcare.gov, Chanos added that the fallout could reduce the likelihood of future government contracts for CGI and even require the company to give money back to the government.",Overvalued by markets,Cash shortage;lackluster product and sales;Accounting misrepresentation;Ineffective management/staff,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,CGI Group Inc.,NYSE,fy2013,1,GV_021864,CGI Inc.,IQ121289,IT Consulting and Other Services,TSX:GIB.A,106.199,10084.624,455.82,0,7233.321,301.289,106.199,7233.321,0,1930.838,2851.303,31.273,2134.706,1311.323,0,0,0,111.111,2683.164,416.889,0,882.004,0,-231.169,475.143,1067.909,-163.941,21.687,-100.14,-3.172,7108.608,966.061,0,10879.272,-338.439,671.257,980.334,627.622,-141.965,0,171.802,0,534.585,455.82,-5.14,0,0,0,3482,0,-102.654,2345.958,455.82,7.727,0,0,-233.855,0,-338.439,0,6823.575,455.82,80.333,0,455.82,80.333,2240.494,1.48042,0,1551.956,1.48042,-535.084,0,307.90003,-535.084,4055.697,1.44,39.312,4055.697,1.44,-30.532,10879.272,316.97418,0,1.96099,0,1.90485,42075,41547,1369.198,0,0,1369.198,-445.971,309.23545,-6.904,(Invalid Formula 0me),1067.909,13.11524,1695.338,-3052.911,326.14,104.981,-9.87245,603.78813,131.552,2880.543,0,-454.751,534.585,27.3734,867.05938,2345.958,0,931.18713,2774.344,109.526,11.369,6936.24,137.088,1227.233,68000,34.714,302

GLRI appears to have failed at oil field development in the past, yet their new plan is more oil field development using debt, likely resulting in eventual shareholder wipeout.

Since Keurig Cold will not be launched until October at the very earliest, it is possible that the company is still working out kinks in the technology. If the technology turns out not to work, the platform may never hit the market.  even if Keurig Cold does hit the market within the next year, the extent to which it represents a competitive threat to SodaStream is still uncertain.

The Street Sweeper said the company had never had an independent investigation done into its ore reserves, regularly and suspiciously paid its CFO on an hourly basis, concocted its own ""mine gross profit"" accounting metric to appear profitable, and managed to appear to be in the gold business when the company ""actually counts silver...as its biggest product by far."" The Street Sweeper said the company had paid out in dividends nearly as much as it had raised from investors and also criticized management, which was made up almost entirely of a single family. On 9-16-2011, The Street Sweeper released another report, saying that the company had promoted inexperienced management, who were mostly from the same family; was using an auditor with a poor track record, Stark Schenkin; had an audit committee chair who had ""launched a string of ill-fated penny-stock companies;"" and had failed to properly disclose some insider sales of stock after it had gone public. ","ranging from undocumented gold reserves to closely related executives to relentless insider sales. GORO has spent most of its time making big promises (sweetened by a handy surge in gold prices) that it consistently fails to keep. Specifically, GORO pegged its average gold price at $1,576 an ounce - a peak seen only one day throughout the entire second quarter - even though the company has traditionally sold all of its gold to a single customer that, with any business savvy at all, could have requested volume discounts or simply purchased that gold at cheaper prices on the regular spot market. It's profitable now, which is good, but it's hugely overvalued for what it is, even what it promises to be later. And finally, let's remind ourselves that GORO hasn't bothered to put together a 43-101 (independent engineering report), and nobody really knows whether what they say about their PM (precious metal) deposits is true or not. gaining access to the capital markets with the help of a new boardroom director who recently caught the attention of Barron's for backing several doomed penny-stock outfits in the past. GORO's official financial statements tell a different story, however. According to those filings, which are subject to standard accounting rules, GORO actually lost $23 million (while generating a paltry $14.75 million in revenue) during 2010 instead. Moreover, a notable chunk of the cash that GORO raised by selling stock last year - very close to the sum spent on dividend payments - disappeared from the company's bank account as well. In mid-June, about two weeks before the second quarter ended, GORO finally hired another contract CFO to replace its top executive - a geologist with no reported background in accounting - as its finance chief, but the company still stopped short of adding a full-time outsider to its incestuous management team. GORO has long preferred to hire its CFO on an hourly basis instead, while relying on the same tarnished auditing firm throughout its entire history as a publicly traded company. Five years after going public, GORO has still yet to supply even a basic 43-101 report that - while short of U.S. regulatory standards for establishing official reserves - would at least add some credibility to the company's internal production estimates.",Incompetent Management,Insider selling;Stock promotion;Accounting misrepresentation;Management turnover;Accounting controls weak;Ineffective management/staff;Growth unsustainable;Unsavory management;Managerial self-dealing,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,Gold Resource Corporation,NYSE MKT,fy2011,1,GV_175503,Gold Reserve Inc.,IQ275541,Gold,OTCPK:GDRZ.F,57.67737,0,-23.61239,1.08707,0,0.06822,58.76444,0,1.88196,0,0,4.28374,0,6.59476,0,0,0,0,59.21444,0,0,20.96023,0,0.44298,19.12563,-10.71934,0,0,-6.5933,0,0,-17.3058,0,78.34007,-6.30659,-17.89944,2.07613,-23.61239,-0.05048,0,0,16.45754,0,-23.61239,0,0,0,0,2.31068,0,0,101.83349,-23.61239,0.96818,0,0,17.37524,0,0,0,104.14417,-23.61239,0,0,-23.61239,0,244.02327,-0.39704,0,-292.18399,-0.39704,-0.00068,0,59.47062,-0.00068,-25.8041,-0.39704,0.01578,-25.8041,-0.39704,0,78.34007,59.47062,0,-0.18187,0,-0.18187,41758,40908,-10.65111,0,0,-10.65111,0.0151,60.24671,-0.50911,(Invalid Formula 0me),-10.71934,-0.43336,0,-25.8041,0,5.6,-0.43336,-10.81613,0,101.83349,0,-0.00068,0,0,1.36978,101.83349,0,5.56368,43.06905,6.71025,-7.96179,76.02939,0,-10.70159,0,0,105

Gotham City said its research indicated that the company lied about the size of contracts, and it said the company's actual revenues were less than 10 million euros. Gotham noted that CEO Jenaro Garcia Martin was previously a director of a penny stock fraud whose shares were revoked by the SEC. Gotham City said Gowex's stated revenue per employee metrics were too good to be true, ""far above nearly all other businesses in history."" Gotham City said 50% of Gowex Telecom's reported revenue came from a related party, Seasuntel S.L., which Gotham City believed was in fact Gowex itself. Gotham said it tested the company's hotspot product, and found it was entirely ineffective. Gotham noted that Gowex's audit fee was only 40,000 euros, which would make sense if actual revenues were only 5-10% of reported revenues, and it said the auditor, M&A Auditores, was entirely unknown, even within Spain, and that Gowex appeared to be its only publicly traded audit client.","Gowexs actual Wireless revenues are at most 10% of what GOW reports in its financial statements.
GOWs Hotspot network it owns or manages is ~5K in size. CEO told us 100K+ & JBCapitalMarkets estimates 35K.
GOWs audit fee is 40,000, which makes sense if Gowexs actual revenues are only 5%-10% of reported revenue.
90% of Telecom revenue originated from undisclosed related parties, tied to GOW CFO & an early investor. We have evidence Gowexs largest customer was really itself.
Gowex Telecom (i.e. Iber-x) website has not been updated in years. It appears to be no longer in business.
Gowex told some investors that New York City was paying them 7.5 million. GOW told us 2 million. The real number is <200,000, according to New York City.
Gowex does not publicly disclose basic metrics, such as hotspot count or wireless revenue segment details.
The head of investor relations is the CEOs wife. She signed off on GOWs annual reports.
The June 5th MallPlaza press release (in English) makes demonstrably false claims. The same press release in the native Spanish omits the false claims.
GOW lied to the European Unions Transparency Register, claiming it spent over 50 mm in political contributions.

Bronte also noted that Gulfport had sold ""productive assets"" to a Wexford managed entity, Diamondback Energy, losing control of the cash flow of those assets. While there was ""nothing obviously wrong"" with such a transaction, Bronte said the move did ""raise governance risks."" Bronte said the oil assets left at the company likely had lower reserves than claimed by the company and new assets being purchased were all invested in Wexford entities.

It is worth asking whether this can be solved by making more spectrum available. Are there great ""fallow fields"" of spectrum?

Even after a recent drop, Globalstar is still up 7x from its 2013 lows. Yet the financials have deteriorated to the point of functional insolvency.

Globalstar has all the elements of promotion: mostly retail investor base, lack of top 20 research coverage and a volatile share price with no support.

Spruce Point said GSOL had weakening fundamentals and significant customer dissatisfaction with online media services. Spruce Point said it found several unusual issues with GSOL's financial reporting, including a lack of standardized reporting metrics, voluntary changes in accounting standards from GAAP to IFRS, changes in auditors over ""fees,"" and multiple CFO and executive transitions. Spruce Point said the company had misallocated significant capital to real estate purchases at the expense of internal investment to its core business. Spruce Point concluded that the company was not run for the benefit of public shareholders.","Global Sources does not appear to be a business that is run for the benefit of public shareholders. The financial strategies undertaken by the Company do not appear transparent and serve the prospects of maximizing shareholder value. Furthermore, there are indications that the underlying businesses are mature and facing significant headwinds, which may explain the recent executive turnover. The Company has determined that investing in Chinese real estate is in the best interest of shareholders, despite the fact that their business model does not appear to justify it from multiple perspectives. We are also concerned by its recent $51m acquisition of Shanghai property at peak prices for no compelling reason. A complicated organizational structure and opaque financial reporting adds further doubt in our minds over the reliability of the financials. We arrive at a $2.50 price target, the midpoint of our range, by giving full credit to the cash on the balance sheet, and discounting the value of the real estate, given our concerns on the legitimacy of the transactions and the illiquidity.

It said the company had $215.6 million in debt and only $19.4 million in cash, with a history of earnings misses and almost five years of net losses that appeared to be worsening. The Street Sweeper further noted that insiders had been selling, especially institutional investors, while executive compensation had more than tripled in the prior year to $8.8 million.","After it settled on providing telecommunications and Internet services, GTT began acquiring companies. It created 45 subsidiaries as it rolled up about half-a-dozen companies into its portfolio. It added a division of MegaPath just last February that cost a whopping $144 million plus $7.5 million in GTT stock.This undoubtedly difficult-to-manage assemblage of small companies has found itself scrambling to compete for a sliver of cloud-based business against established companies such as AT&T, Xo Holdings, Verizon and Microsoft.

Insiders Yell Sell, Baby, Sell!So heres the deal. GTTs dangerous roll-up strategy, massive debt, substantial losses, crazy executive compensation, selling by insiders who know the business better than anyone, institutional selling, and ridiculously high stock price all point to disaster lurking ahead.

TheStreetSweeper believes GTTs financial state will force the company to attempt to sell millions of shares that would dilute current shares. But a stock offering would be difficult for three reasons: First, the GTT story would be a very hard-sell in todays market. Second, any potential GTT investors who glimpsed the outrageous 38 to 1 price-to-forward-earnings ratio would run.

to be deceptive because Greek Gods contains only one-third of the protein and 400% more fat

catching on, and sales growth is sharply decelerating. Hain is currently defending against a class

RH analytics concluded that ""policy shrinkage and premium declines at times"" was natural, but that investors would ultimately shy away from ""a business model that, absent subsidies, exhibits negative operating leverage."" On 9-16-2014, in a significantly longer and more detailed report, RH Analytics began a series of posts discussing HCI Group's business model. Examining the Florida insurance market and concluding that HCI was not well positioned for long-term success, RH said that limited profitability ""makes the takeout business model only marginally profitable in the best of times."" Two days later, RH Analytics followed up, saying that state subsidies helped HCI create the appearance of ""software-like margins"" that were in fact just an ""illusion.""

On 9-24-2014, RH Analytics said HCI's reinsurance program was inadequate and that ""related party reinsurance vehicles"" were particularly concerning.

On 10-2-2014, RH Analytics said HCI's ""loss-limit tactics are aggressive and reserves understated"" and detailed what it said were a series of misleading accounting tactics.

On 10-16-2014, RH Analytics said HCI was a ""poor steward of shareholder capital"" and paid management excessively, in addition to poorly timed share buybacks, underwriting flood insurance, and other strategically poor financial decisions.

On 11-6-2014, RH Analytics predicted that HCI would report poor Q3 results. Results reported later that day beat consensus estimates. On 3-27-2015, RH Analytics posted a review of the company's 10-K, concluding that it showed ""more of the same"" in line with the group's previous criticism. The group disclosed that it currently held no position in the stock.

On 6-22-2015, RH Analytics said HCI's corporate governance standards were ""sub-standard"" and let management ""disregard shareholder interests.""

On 8-5-2015, RH Analytics said contradictory comments by management regarding growth opportunities overshadowed the company's better-than-expected earnings and were not credible.

On 9-18-2015, RH Analytics said HCI's losses were likely understated because its loss ratio had been lower than average for a long period of time and didn't resemble the pool from which the policies were drawn or those of competitors.

On 10-15-2015, RH Analytics questioned the longevity of the takeout business model, as RH Analytics said that there was a movement in the Florida legislature to curtail takeouts and that consumer rejection rates for takeout offers were skyrocketing. On 3-7-2016, RH Analytics said that the multiple positive surprises in HCI's 4Q15 results were anomalies that would disappear, and it said that the focus on HCI's new Tytap flood insurance company seemed designed to provide distraction from the company's eroding business.","HCI is a Florida P&C insurer with a business model that is the product of the dysfunctional and politically driven Florida homeowners' insurance market.

HCI's extraordinarily high ROE is largely driven by state subsidies embedded in the timing and terms of takeouts from Citizens.

He said that since the company's sales estimates relied on patients perpetually remaining on a drug that did not provide meaningful improvements, insurance pressures and the large patient copay would cause a decline in revenue over time. Shkreli also noted Benlysta's slow launch and estimated global peak sales of $750 million for the drug. Shkreli estimated 40% downside, and he said that when Human Genome Sciences reported Q3 and Q4 earnings, investors would quickly exit.","Lupus is a highly symptomatic disease where unless a flare is prevented or the severity lessened, patients and physicians arent served. Benlysta doesnt seem to do either, instead it seems to provide a very small benefit in a highly variable disease. Lofty sales estimates rely on Benlysta patients remaining on Benlysta, an unlikely to occur scenario as the large patient copay and insurance pressures limit perpetual revenue drugs from patients who are not clearly benefitting. I could see revenue for Benlysta peak soon and then begin to decline sequentially as patient time on drug shrinks.

Pearson noted stagnation in the company's revenues over the last five quarters and an overdependence on revenue from just a few products, particularly fluticasone, which he said was facing ""rapid"" collapse in profitability in the face of new competitors. In addition, he highlighted Medicaid fraud investigations in both TX and MA into the company for providing false information to receive an inflated reimbursement. Pearson further took issue with two brothers, who act as CEO and Vice Chairman, and their management of the company and its subsidiaries to elevate their own personal earnings.","over-dependence on a single drug, fluticasone (generic for Flonase), which generates 42% of revenues and nearly 70% of net income and which has very recently become commoditized by additional new competitors, leading to a rapid and extreme collapse in profitability. Based on statements from management, this decline is expected to further accelerate in coming quarters.
a second lead product, dorzolamide, which accounts for more than 20% of sales is also in rapid and steady decline, as described my managementon their last conference call.
as part of its Medicaid fraud investigation, the Attorney General for the state of Texas recently sent Hi-Tech a Civil Investigative Demandinvestigating false reporting of information to establish reimbursement rates for Medicaid. The Attorney General recently demanded that Hi-Tech produce 50 categories of documents pertaining to Medicaid drug pricing and sales by Hi-Tech.
this follows on the heals of a Massachusetts whistleblower civil actionnaming Hi-Tech for violations of the Federal False Claims Act. The Massachusetts civil action stated that the defendants knowingly submitted false records or statements causing false claims false to be made for unapproved or ineffective drugs, including Hi-Techs Lodrane.With Hi-Tech, 11 different drug products were identified with false claims totaling $46 million. The civil action is seeking treble damagesas well as civil penalties.
Following the Massachusetts Civil Action, the FDA cited Hi-techs Lodrane as an Unapproved Prescription Cough, Cold, and Allergy Productand Hi-Tech was forced to discontinue sales. Prior sales had amounted to over $19 million while losses on discarded Lodrane inventory amounted to an additional $1 million.
in 2010, Hi-Tech received its second FDA warning letter, which stated that your firm manufactures a prescription drug without an approved application and you must cease manufacturing and distributing all your unapproved new drug products. Then again in 2011, Hi-Tech received an FDA Form 483 (which precedes a formal warning letter) citing 7 observations which have not yet been disclosed in detail.
in the past 4 months alone, nearly $5 million of selling by a wide range of insiders including David and Reuben Selzter, additional members of senior management as well as board members. Nearly $3 million of this selling came within the last 45 days, after Hi-Techs last earnings miss and at prices below the current share price.

Levinsky noted High Liner's growth in sales and EBITDA but declining volumes for the prior 13 quarters, and he said that High Liner's prediction of $150MM in EBITDA in 2016 would be difficult to manage due to a lack of balance sheet flexibility and inability to drive cost cuts.","Have seen growth in sales and EBITDA yet volumes have declined 13 quarters in a row, margins have compressed.

On 10-2-2012, Einhorn said he would not talk about Herbalife at the Value Investing Congress that day, and the stock traded higher.CNBC's Kate Kelly said that Ackman believed the company was a pyramid scheme and that he would present his thesis at the Ira Sohn conference the next day. On 12-20-2012, Ackman announced at the Ira Sohn conference that Pershing Square had an ""enormous"" short position in Herbalife stock. At the conference, Ackman expanded on his pyramid scheme allegation in a three-hour presentation, saying that distributors earned 10 times as much from recruitment as they did by selling the company's ""overpriced products to bona fide retail customers."" Ackman said he did not own any options, but instead held a short position on 20 million common shares (worth approximately $1 billion). Pershing Square said it did not consult with Einhorn on the short-selling thesis. (The next day, Pershing Square announced the launch of factsaboutherbalife.com, a website to support its campaign.) On 7-30-2013, Pershing Square raised questions about the company's earnings and accounting. Among several other issues, Pershing Square questioned the company's operating earnings and its use of unrealistic Venezuelan exchange rates. On 7-31-2013, Ackman told CNBC that he hadn't covered a single share of HLF. Also on 7-31-2013, CNBC reported that Soros Fund Management had taken a large long position in Herbalife.
 On 9-11-2013, media outlets reported that Pershing Square sent a 52-page letter to PwC, warning the auditor that if it failed ""to accurately inform investors"" that the company may be a pyramid scheme, ""PwC may incur substantial liabilities."" PwC said it would not comment on the matter, due to client confidentiality.

On 10-2-2013, Pershing Square sent a letter to investors, informing them, ""In order to mitigate the risk of further mark-to-market losses on Herbalife, in recent weeks we have restructured the position by reducing our short equity position by more than 40% and replacing it with long-term derivatives, principally over-the-counter put options."" On 3-11-2014, Pershing Square webcast a presentation examining Herbalife's business in China, where multi-level marketing businesses are outlawed. Pershing Square said that in fact the ruling provided evidence that the FTC would succeed in shutting down Herbalife, as the illegal elements of BurnLounge's business model closely paralleled Herbalife's own practices.
Pershing Square noted that a recently disclosed video of Herbalife's CEO emphasizing recruiting undermined the existence of the company's retail sales, and it said that the company still refused to collect retail sales information. Pershing Square also said that regulatory investigations into Herbalife were still ongoing, and it noted that the Vemma complaint provided a potential road-map for the courts. It additionally said that state action by New York senator Jeff Klein concluded that Herbalife distributors were ""running an illegal pyramid scheme"" and proposed state legislation that would amend NY General Business Law. Pershing Square said Herbalife's recent financial results had been weak and that ""the pyramid [was] no longer growing.""","Herbalife overstates the amount of income that is likely to be made by new

On 7-18-2012, Chanos presented his short thesis on Hewlett-Packard at CNBC's Delivering Alpha conference in New York. Chanos said the personal computing business was in decline and that tablets and smartphones would continue to eat away at PC sales. Chanos also said that HP had been hiding the true cost of its research and development through acquisitions. Chanos said that once the cost of acquisitions was taken into account, revenues and cash flow at HP were ""basically flat.""On 4-24-2013 and 10-10-2013, Chanos told CNBC he was still short HP. Chanos said he was seeing revenue contraction at the company. On 8-21-2015, Chanos said in a CNBC interview that he was still short HP and said the company's businesses were in secular decline. He also noted the widest discrepancy between HP's actual earnings and its pro forma earnings, making the stock more expensive.On 10-30-2015, in an interview with CNN, Chanos said that Hewlett-Packard's split would not make a difference and was the epitome of everything that was wrong with the company. Chanos said that the split was ""financial engineering"" and that the company's CEO was running the company as if it was a long-term dying business. Chanos added that the company was losing revenues at 5-10% per year and that Hewlett-Packard ultimately was doomed.
","""I'm puzzled as a financial analyst and a business analyst why this is an attractive deal,"" he added, noting that Dell's ""cash flow is plummeting.""

The Street Sweeper said Sustol had already been rejected by the FDA twice for many of the same reasons both times. Even if Sustol were approved, The Street Sweeper said it would face stiff competition in ""a market filled with established and developing drugs"" for the same medical problems as Sustol. As part of the report, The Street Sweeper interviewed the company's CEO, who said he expected another ""small"" equity raise ""at some point in time.""","At some point in time, well probably do a small equity raise to top off the tank, CEO Barry Quart told TheStreetSweeper.Asked why he has been selling Heron stock - $130,000 worth in the past few weeks - he said that has nothing to do with his perception of the companys future.Those stock sales, along with sales by another officer, have occurred amid a stock price pop of some 40 percent since January. Eager, biotech-fevered investors have been looking for study results for Herons top candidate, Sustol, plus eventual FDA approval to begin marketing, along with more news of its post-operative pain gel.What they got was entirely different. Heron launched another round of equity/convertible debt  a more than $57 million public offering.So, product launch was toned down to resubmitting the NDA  and again delayed.Before the much-touted Sustol study results come in and before another attempt to get FDA approval, both Mr. Quart and the technical operations senior vice president, Paul Marshall, sold stock.Yet Heron has not been stingy with salary, options and other compensation for the top six executives  and Mr. Quart earns the second-highest pay.Should Heron get FDA approval, Sustol (an NK-1 antagonist) will be trying to squeeze out meaningful sales in a market filled with established and developing drugs for the very same chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting CINV use.Even then, the miniscule revenue of 2011 and 2010 is revenue received from two companies terminating agreements with Heron, with one company saying it simply did not see the commercial potential of the product. Thats despite the fact the application hasnt even been resubmitted to the FDA, much less received approval.

And despite the fact Heron has never manufactured at a commercial level.

An acquisition less than three years ago resulted in management implicitly valuing IBP's currency 95% lower than the current stock price. Management altered capex definition from the original S1.

Detailed allegations from employee lawsuits accuse IBP of requiring its installers to falsify work documentation, which if true, would be in violation of State and Federal laws.

IBP's CEO appears to also be the CEO of another company, which shares the same mailing address as IBP, and we believe is a customer of IBP.

Our base case implies IBP's shares have at least 40% downside & analysis of the pending Masco installation spin-off suggests IBP is at least 50% overvalued. Any suspicion towards IBP's related party dealings was given further credence by the recent insider transaction. On March 16, 2015, IBP announced they had repurchased $6.1 million of common stock in a privately negotiated transaction with an entity called IBS. Buying back stock is typically a shareholder friendly activity and a sign of management's confidence in the business.

Greenwich Research said Cash Call's strong first quarter was due to a refinancing wave that would not repeat in future quarters. Greenwich Research said much of Cash Call's profits over the next several years were promised to its previous owners, further depressing any real positive results the acquisition would have for Impac. Greenwich Research also argued that Impac's other business operations were losing money. On 11-13-2015, Greenwich Research commented on Impac's quarterly earnings report and said that originations would continue to fall dramatically. Greenwich Research also said that Impac's reported earnings per share was very misleading because most of the profit was generated through a reduction in the ""expected"" amounts owed on an earlier Cash Call acquisition, and Greenwich Research said that without this accounting entry, earnings would have come in at $0.18. It said that the company would need to raise cash very early in 2016 and also noted the company's bait-and-switch advertising tactics, which Greenwich Research said was a business practice that had resulted in lawsuits from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.","Recent stock runup due solely to acquisition of Cash Call.

Cash Call successfully sued by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau and a number of states for deceptive and abusive practices, harassment and charging customers interest rates of 100%+.

Cash Call is a refinancing machine that generated huge profits in Q1, 2015, but that won't continue and is already waning.

Most all profits from Cash Call must be paid back to previous owners.

Because sales representatives had an incentive-based pay structure and its drug was ""wildly addictive and makes you massively high,"" Bronte said the structure was ""almost designed for something to go wrong."" Bronte noted a report on the previous Friday of a doctor in Michigan arrested for Medicare fraud that had been responsible for ""20.3 percent of Subsys"" prescriptions. Bronte suspected that the liquid form that Subsys came in made it more susceptible to diversion to illegal sources. Bronte said that ""at a minimum the Feds will investigate the [company's] sales practices and their link to the Michigan doctor."" He said the suspicious sales model and potential off-label marketing made the company ""as good as a candidate as any for government closure."" Bronte also noted a lack of patent protection for the product. On 5-13-2014, Bronte noted that while no company sells directly to physicians, all companies educated doctors directly about their drug in hopes that doctors would prescribe it. It was this interaction that Bronte said allowed for the off-label marketing. Bronte also said it did not seem that the fraudulent doctor in Michigan was required to sign an agreement with patients before prescribing Subsys.

On 5-15-2014, Bronte followed up on his report, highlighting that the New York Times had put out a story on Insys. The New York Times found that interviews with former sales reps suggested the company had marketed Subsys to doctors who did not treat many cancer patients, the drug's target patient. The story noted that Insys had received a subpoena in December and was cooperating with the government's investigation.","Insys Therapeutics (INSY:NASDAQ) is a seller of marijuana based anti-nausea drugs and super-strong opiates (Fentanyl) and nothing much else.

Prescience Point pointed to an SEC comment letter from October 2012 that questioned InnerWorkings' accounting practices. Also noted in the report were major corporate governance concerns, including the departure of four of seven directors in 2012, unusually high management salaries and insider sales just before InnerWorkings lost a major contract. Prescience Point noted several other key issues: lagging business performance, overstated market opportunity, opaque acquisitions and increased risk exposure to foreign markets.","IW lures investors with its ""huge"" opportunity to crack the ""$500bn"" printing market. We believe IW is both mischaracterizing the market opportunity and its revenues. IW persistently touts its revenue growth, which has largely been achieved through an opaque and aggressive roll-up strategy that uses accounting tricks to defer costs to future periods, while artificially boosting current EBITDA and EPS .
At the heart of IW's revenue shenanigans are its misapplication of gross vs. net accounting. We have had its customer and supplier documents reviewed by a 3rd party accounting expert, and conclude IW is blatantly violating GAAP. IW has no inventory risk as it never takes title to goods, and makes suppliers provide a full warranty for its products. The SEC is already hot on IW's tail and issued a comment letter in October 2012 which questioned, among other things, the company's use of gross revenue accounting. IW is clearly struggling, and not growing nearly as fast as it is reporting. Investors should have been spooked in 2012 when two directors resigned, while two others decided not to stand for reelection. IW has worked hard to convince sell-side analysts that it is a revenue growth machine, worthy of a higher stock price.

Instead, Spruce Point said the company was struggling because of changes in the housing market and competition from other robotic vacuum companies. Spruce Point said the company was using aggressive accounting to boost its earnings, including reclassifications and one-time warranty gains. Spruce Point noted that sales and marketing spending had eclipsed research and development as the company attempted to maintain growth level sales. Spruce Point said the company's patent portfolio and plans for growth in telepresence ""appear to be carrots to keep investors from selling its shares.""On 9-4-2014, Spruce Point released a second report, criticizing the companies counting of one-time adjustments to improve its quarterly numbers. Spruce Point argued that growth would need to be explosive for the rest of the year for the company to hit its full year guidance and that the potential growth for iRobot's Roomba in China was much lower than the company had led investors to believe.","iRobot has seen its stock rise irrationally due to investor speculation of a Robotics Revolution, caused by hype over small investments by companies such as Google and Amazon in robotics.

Now, with falling energy prices and a decrease in organic growth, Spruce Point argued that the company offered zero advantage over its competitors. As the company struggled to pay off $755 million in debt due over the next five years, Spruce Point argued a dividend cut, in addition to the cut already made in February 2013, would be imminent. Spruce Point criticized the company's ""debt-fueled acquisition spree"" and many of the specific companies Just Energy had chosen to acquire. Spruce Point also said the company was using ""moderately aggressive accounting"" to mislead investors about its decline.","We estimate the company is incapable of producing sufficient cash flow to cover the reduced C$122m/year dividend burden, rendering its dividend policy unsustainable.

He still owns more than 2 million options at this point, however, all of them carrying strike prices of $1.75 a share or less. Right now, with Jive trading at the high end of its impressive 52-week range, he is worth almost $70 million on paper as a result.

Einhorn said Greenlight's on-the-ground research indicated that St. Joe's land was worth far less than its carrying value on the company's balance sheet, and Greenlight said the company should take several asset impairments. Greenlight also said the company should return to its roots as a rural land company, which Greenlight said would be worth $7-10 per share, with modest additional value for the company's additional acreage. (Einhorn had previously discussed his short position in St. Joe at the Ira Sohn conference in May 2007, but the 2010 thesis was far more detailed.)

In an email to The Wall Street Journal, St. Joe defended its value, and it said it continued to ""focus on the execution of our strategic plan in order to maximize the value of our assets.""","St. Joe Company has a significant amount of investments in Florida real estate, both commerical and residential; those investments are largely along the states' Gulf coast, though some are on the Atlantic coast.
Those investments appear to be highly overvalued on the balance sheet of St. Joe Company.
Many of the projects exist as ""ghost towns"" where no one is living.
The company has, essentially, not marked the value of these lots and properties to market, and its current balance sheet is, therefore, misleading to investors.
The company has claimed the value of certain properties would increase in the past, notably via an international airport's development in Panama City. That airport is now complete.
The company is suing those companies involved in the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. But, according to Einhorn, the company has publicly claimed there is no oil on beaches near their properties.
Einhorn remarked, when asked if there was anyway he could be wrong about his position, ""They could discover real oil"" (as in , their properties could be sitting on oil).",Accounting Fraud,accounting misrepresentation;overinvestment by company;aggressive accounting;accounting fraud,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,St. Joe Company,NYSE,fy2010,1,GV_012544,The St. Joe Company,IQ188196,Diversified Real Estate Activities,NYSE:JOE,183.827,99.54,-35.864,0,62.288,13.657,183.827,62.288,4.799,10.283,37.252,5.159,16.014,30.316,0,0,0,0,199.841,13.657,0,49.86,0,-15.968,13.014,-41.504,0,0,-7.142,64.637,0,-49.704,0,1051.695,-10.05,16.312,14.977,-59.754,-1.282,0,-23.849,0.12,0,-35.905,0,0,0,0,47.886,0,0,54.651,-35.864,0.65,0,0,-0.512,0.313,-5.251,0,179.258,-35.864,0,0,-35.864,0,935.603,-0.39121,0,878.498,-0.39121,0,-931.431,91.67435,0,872.124,-0.39121,5.083,872.437,-0.39121,-1.307,1051.695,91.67435,0,-0.33842,0,-0.33842,41334,40543,-27.847,0,91.77625,-32.155,4.22,91.77625,20.02,(Invalid Formula 0me),-41.504,9.50272,-25.847,872.124,2,4.505,9.50272,-31.024,-65.061,54.651,0,0,0,NM,46.4915,54.651,0,51.874,-129.176,0,-60.28,927.088,0.141,-29.129,118,-23.99,47

Because Anonymous Analytics believed so much of IMM's accounting to be fraudulent, it expected Joy Global to write down IMM's value substantially. It argued this could pose considerable risk to the company because IMM represented a significant percentage of Joy Global's total market cap. Anonymous Analytics also noted that since issues with Caterpillar's bad deal had become public, Joy Global had said it did not anticipate similar problems with IMM.","Recently, concerns regarding the integrity of IMMs financial information have

The week before, Caterpillar disclosed that it had written down over a half billion dollars from a recent acquisition after it discovered ""deliberate, multi-year, coordinated accounting misconduct"" at its acquisition. Two prominent figures in that company, ERA Mining Machinery, were Li Rubo and Emory Williams. Zhou said that these two men together owned at least 9%, and possibly up to 45% due to interests in other funds, of IMM. Because these men were closely associated with a company that had engaged in such serious fraudulent accounting, Zhou said it was likely that IMM was also worth considerably less than expected. Joy Global spent approximately $1.4 billion to acquire IMM, and Zhou believed a write-down of as much as $1 billion could be coming.","What we discovered at Siwei following the acquisition was deliberate, multi-year, coordinated accounting misconduct that was concealed by the persons responsible.I believe a detailed internal review and audit of International Mining Machinery is warranted by Joy Global in light of the recent scandal reported by Caterpillar. While it is difficult to predict the outcome of such investigation and what level of write-down Joy may ultimately take, it is most likely going to be very significant given the size of its IMM acquisition, the percentage reported in Caterpillar's write-down and the important connections shown between IMM and ERA.

GeoInvesting said the company's recent earnings report showed high net income growth because of non-recurring gains from options and futures contracts on coffee resulting from a 30-year high in coffee prices. GeoInvesting criticized the company had failed to make the source of its income clear to the market, and it noted that insiders had been selling stock worth millions of dollars in recent days. GeoInvesting posted a summary of the report to Seeking Alpha a week later.","The stock appears to have rallied as a result of what we suspect were unnoticed and consider to be non-operating items in its fiscal 2011 quarterly earnings reports. These items may have created the appearance of strong earnings growth when in fact it seems apparent that core earnings are decaying. To the contrary, for the same time period, if we remove the gains from the company's earnings, as would be appropriate for unpredictable non-recurring items, the earnings actually declined year over year by 37%. Repeat: they declined. In their press releases, we believe that management failed to effectively communicate to the market that the net income growth in both quarters was essentially entirely a result of gains made through the purchase and sale of options and futures contracts to manage the purchase of coffee. the company has decided to say nothing in its earnings press releases, paving the way for the stock to rally on hype and hot air.Even more troubling is the fact that management is now capitalizing on the stocks questionable price surge by dumping shares as the stock has rallied. Coffee prices are currently tapering off of an all-time 30 year high.

Pump Stopper said the company's backlog was ""massively overstated"" and uninformed sell-side promoters were a large reason for the company's elevated stock price. Pump Stopper said ineffective roll-ups had gotten to the company into its insolvency problems. It also said a lawsuit against the company concerning a variety of breaches of security called into question whether or not KEYW would be able to find and retain new customers.

Pump Stopper lauded other, much more dominant players in the market and stressed that KEYW was not a cyber company.

Pump Stopper also noted that institutional investors were selling off shares, and it predicted an equity offering, which had already been filed for, in the coming weeks.","KEYW faces looming covenant violations and a high probability of bankruptcy. I walk you through the unforgiving math below.

KEYWs backlog accounting presents a headline number that appears massively overstated.

KEYW is NOT a high-margin cyber-security software company. Investors have been misled by promotional research from underwriters who earn huge investment banking fees from KEYW.

KEYWs true business is low-margin government contracting and, based on true peer comparable valuations, KEYWs fair value is $3.80 -- if the company can avoid bankruptcy. This lawsuit indicates KEYW is coming apart at the seams internally with credibility and ethical standards called into question.

Allegations against KEYW include Unlawful security breaches, Data Removal, Violations of Security Policy and more. These allegations are the worst possible behavior I can imagine for a security company.

The lifeblood of any security company is it's integrity. With KEYW's reputation damaged in a close-knit defense community I wonder: who will want to hire KEYW?

KEYW had to settle this suit for $4.8m and, since KEYW apparently couldn't afford any other option, had to pay the settlement in installments.

The Street Sweeper said that the company faced major competition from bigger companies in the inkjet printing space, its roll-to-roll product was late to market, its distribution faced challenges, and an impending stock lock-up expiration would further dilute share value. The Street Sweeper said it expected Kornit's stock to ""fall prey to the elements and collapse in a ­heap."" On 7-7-2015, The Street Sweeper said a recent acquisition of a top competitor increased pressure on the roll-to-roll printing market and its deal price showed that Kornit would be valued between $1.88 and $4.26 per share using similar metrics.","Misunderstood hype - Due to analyst hype, market erroneously believes inkjet printer Kornit is a 3D printing company, and has assigned a correspondingly ridiculous valuation - one Kornit can't grow into.

Not 3D - Using a commercially available printer head and boasting just ~7 patents, Kornit printers lack a legitimate reason to possibly justify any comparison to 3D printers.

With a deficit of $669 million over its 27 years of operating, the ""exceedingly optimistic picture"" painted by management did nothing to assuage declining revenues across several segments of the company's business. Due to the risk involved, the company's overvaluation compared to other firms, and stiff competition, Lemelson said the stock would fall to $0.On 7-3-2014, Lemelson released a follow-up report, saying no comments since its report had shown how the company had anything other than a single drug supporting its revenues. Lemelson also said a ""highly complex arrangement"" with another company, Viking Therapeutics, was only a ""shell for Ligand to further access public markets"" and deserved extra scrutiny from investors. On 7-17-2014, Lemelson said in a press release about its quarterly performance that Ligand was ""radically overvalued and essentially insolvent."" Lemelson said the stock was ""indicative of an irrefutable bubble in biotech stocks.""","Revenue and profits highly concentrated in one (single-sourced) product, and essentially two royalty agreements, one of which is set to decline precipitously.

Based on recent FDA comments, Gileads revolutionary Sovaldi drug will virtually eliminate demand for Promacta, which is Ligands largest royalty generating asset, accounting for as much as 72 percent of Ligand royalty revenue as recently as Q4 2013.

Tilson said that LL's margins were artificially high, in part due to buying illegal wood in Asia. Tilson said that it was unlikely that LL would be significantly fined by authorities for the transgression, but that its margins would suffer once it was no longer buying illegal wood. Tilson gave a two-year price target of $53 per share.Tilson argued that the company's revenue would take a significant hit as ""a ton of local news outlets"" across the country picked up the bad news about LL. The ensuing fall in revenues, a decrease in margins after the company was forced to being selling more expensive wood, and any legal and liability problems would cause the stock to decline further, according to Tilson. Whitney Tilson said the unexpected resignation of the CEO portended more bad things for the company, including ""decisive action"" by regulators ""to rein in and punish this rogue company."" Tilson said the federal raid could hurt the company in several ways and that a new competitor had cropped up, pressuring LL even further. tilson argued that the company's revenue would take a significant hit as ""a ton of local news outlets"" across the country picked up the bad news about LL. On 1-29-2015, Tilson said a new report by the Environmental Investigation Agency found Lumber Liquidators had been in part supplied by Russian mobsters illegally harvesting hardwoods in Siberia and then smuggling the wood to Chinese processing mills, which sold it to LL. A Russian court convicted senior executives of the Russian timber company Beryozoviy in December 2014 for illegal logging occurring between 2010 and 2012. and any legal and liability problems would cause the stock to decline further, according to Tilson. On 3-23-2015, Tilson published a new article, arguing that while he had previously thought the company's bad behavior was ""run of the mill,"" it's response since the 60 minutes report led him to believe the company was ""evil"" and intentionally deceiving the public about its practices and products' safety.The same day, Whitney Tilson said the unexpected resignation of the CEO portended more bad things for the company, including ""decisive action"" by regulators ""to rein in and punish this rogue company.""On 6-2-2015, Tilson said that the company's chief compliance officer had departed the company, which LL had so far failed to disclose. The company later confirmed the departure to the New York Post.On 11-16-2015, at the Robin Hood Investors Conference, Tilson said that the company's business was likely permanently impaired and that it remained a significant short position.","Remaining arguments from summary: I received information that leads me to believe that senior management of

Lumber Liquidators, per their 8-K released on March 2nd, is contesting the methods in which the testing was performed.

After reviewing California standards for formaldehyde testing and methods which were used by 60 Minutes and Tilson, we conclude that the test results are likely authentic and accurate.

Lumber Liquidators cash position, per the 2014 10-K, is an anemic $20.3 million in cash and $47.3 million left on a revolving credit facility. We think the company needs cash.

Chanos said liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand was no longer growing, while capacity was going to double over the next four years despite there already being excess capacity. Chanos suggested Cheniere's take-or-pay contracts were not as safe as people believed, as some industry take-or-pay contracts were being renegotiated. On 10-12-2015, in an interview with Bloomberg, Chanos said that Cheniere's plans to export liquefied natural gas from the U.S. would leave the company burdened with over $30 billion in debt. Chanos added that half of the companys projected 2020 earnings would depend on how much gas the company could sell into the spot market, noting that the company would owe about $2 billion of interest payments each year and that its equipment would depreciate by about $1 billion annually. Chanos said that Cheniere faced an actual annual EBITDA of $1.7 billion from seven trains generated by contracted volumes, and Chanos added that the company's annual EBITDA did not factor in possible delays to LNG train buildout, which Chanos said was common across the industry. Chanos also said that Cheniere faced difficulty finding buyers willing to commit to long-term contracts. He noted that 87% of Cheniere's commissioned capacity was on ""take or pay"" contracts, which Chanos said represented less than half of Cheniere's ideal EBITDA, and he said that 13% of Cheniere's capacity was uncontracted and would struggle to break even regardless of destination. Chanos said that most of Cheniere's LNG trains were not completed and still needed funding, and Chanos also said that Cheniere's management was unsure if its first LNG cargo would meet its Q4 2015 target.
","""We've been pretty negative for the past six months on this LNG space. We think it's a looming disaster,"" the founder and president of Kynikos Associates said on ""Squawk Box."" It's a little bit tied into Asia,"" Chanos said of his latest short. ""LNG was seen as a savior of a lot of natural gas plays, a way to basically satiate the incredible demand for energy out of Asia. The problem is ... everybody figured it out ... at the same time.""""[But] with the stock at 30 times 2020 earnings, with the upside coming from a glutted market,"" he continued, ""we think the risk-reward in this, given where other LNG plays are in Australia and elsewhere, is just completely out-of-whack.",Competitve Headwinds,Growth unsustainable;Customer retention issues;Contract not as valuable as perceived;business model pressure;Debt default risk;Aggressive accounting;Strategy issues,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Cheniere Energy, Inc.",NYSE MKT,fy2015,1,GV_029453,"Cheniere Energy, Inc.",IQ374377,Oil and Gas Storage and Transportation,AMEX:LNG,1201.112,270,-975,0,122,83,1201.752,122,91,0,148,172,5.749,363,0,18.125,0,-1,1782.586,83,-28,16645.193,0,2,16193.907,-333,-4,20.878,-526,0,76.819,-857,0,18809.053,-240,-483,22.82,-1097,-6853,15,0,0,1692.878,-1097,0,0,0,0,2185.268,0,0,14999.667,-975,0,0,0,-6984,2463.253,-61,0,17247.65,-975,7073,0,-975,7073,0.708,-4.29705,0,-3623.948,-4.29705,0,-353.927,226.9,0,-901.85,-4.3,2,1561.403,-4.3,-61,18809.053,226.9,0,-1.82294,0,-1.82294,43152,42369,-250,0,228.103,-250,6423,228.103,-1044,(Invalid Formula 0me),-333,-3.9537,-209,-978.669,41,123,-4.29047,-413.625,0,16707.545,0,7073,1707.878,0,-6888.306,14999.667,0,-6607.556,15505.793,177,-198.569,18268.948,2,-7103,888,-2,672

Suhail also said that El Pollo Loco had a long history of failed domestic expansion and had not meaningfully grown the El Pollo Loco brand outside of its core Los Angeles market. Suhail added that the company had missed opportunities to expand because it spent most of the early 1990s in the portfolio of a holding company mired in junk bond mania debt. Suhail said that American Securities Capital Partners had later buried El Pollo Loco in debt between 2003 and 2005, and Suhail said a leveraged buyout by Trimaran Capital followed in 2005. Suhail also said that El Pollo Loco's pre-IPO comparable same-store sales numbers were misleading and should be heavily discounted, as Suhail said they were largely driven by average check growth through menu price increases. Suhail set a price target of $6 over 12-18 months or over 70% downside.","El Pollo Loco was a hot franchise chain with amazing growth prospects 30 years ago. Today
 its
 still just an LA staple that is probably going to have to work very hard just to maintain its grip on what it already has.

 pre-IPO comp numbers and margin expansion are somewhat misleading. Significant price increases/menu mix shift into a rebounding economy have been the driver, and thus should be heavily discounted by investors. Setting aside what repeated failed domestic expansions implies about the brand

Zhou gave Bloomberg a preview of a post he intended to publish to Seeking Alpha on Friday, May 1. The piece would show and discuss the test results from a sample found at a Texas store that was labeled as being compliant with California's standard. In response to Bloomberg, Lowe's said that it was ""confident our products are safe"" but would respond to customers' concerns. Bloomberg said flooring generally, and not laminate flooring specifically, made up only 6% of Lowe's sales and 90% of Lowe's flooring products were sourced domestically.

In Zhou's post, he said an industry source tested some of Lowe's laminate flooring and found formaldehyde at 10x the allowable level in one sample. Questioning whether others in the industry might also be culpable, Zhou's source also checked other retailers and found CARB 2 compliant labels had been removed from boxes.","Further research confirms that Lowes is guilty of formaldehyde noncompliance in sourcing laminate flooring from China.

The Consumer Products Safety Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency need to include Lowes products in their safety testing.

The money that was received from Apple has already been used to fund operations and retire debt.

The current rumors propelling the stock are that Apple may use the Liquidmetal technology in the iPhone 5.

The pants debacle cost LULU an estimated $75 million -$86 million expected to cut earnings per share by 11 cents to 12 cents. But now, the company has pulled more garments and even more recalls could be ahead.

Last Friday, the company pulled clothing made of its candy-striped Luon fabric but did so quietly, notifying only a minority of customers who happened to catch the recall mention on LULUs Facebook page. This comes almost a month after the initial recall of the core black Luon womens pants. TheStreetSweeper wanted to ask LULU why the candy-striped bottoms were no longer listed on its website this week but LULU declined an interview. But now we believe the company is in a tailspin, producing lower quality products and products customers just dont like (just two examples of scores of negative comments posted on Lululemon Addict and Lulumum about new products this week: That silver lining tank is the epitome of hideous.  Wow could those be more unflattering and cheap looking?) Thus, LULUs losing customers even as competitors rush to fill the gap.

Citron said that without a patent or superior technology, Mobileye could not remain dominant past two years in an industry with no barriers of entry. Citron called the company's valuation ""absurd"" compared with other semiconductor companies and noted nearly unprecedented insider selling since its IPO. It gave a short-term price target of $25 and a long-term price target of $10.On 9-24-2015, Citron Research lowered its short-term price target on Mobileye to $20, saying that the recent Volkswagen scandal highlighted how desperate automakers were to cut costs and eventually the industry would not tolerate Mobileye's huge margins.

On 12-16-2015, Citron Research tweeted that Mobileye was its ""short of the year."" Citron also included a link to an Electrek article that said Tesla's Elon Musk offered a ""multimillion-dollar bonus"" to George Hotz for him to build a ""Mobileye crushing"" autopilot system. Shares closed down about 7%.
","Mobileye's R&D budget is miniscule, and completely outclassed in the
auto industry. We are well aware that insider selling is a normal part of the IPO business. Yet
what we have seen at Mobileye is something we have never witnessed. It all
started with the IPO and continued in the secondary.

However, Suhail Capital pointed out that the company faced growing competition over the next 12 months, including from a former partner, and that some of Mobileye's current customers had already switched to competitor stereo cameras. While Suhail Capital called the company innovative with impressive technology, it said Mobileye's shares did not reflect its position in the ADAS automotive market. Suhail Capital estimated 35%-50% downside. The report was posted on 8-18-2015 to Seeking Alpha's pro section and became public on 8-19-2015. On 12-21-2015, Suhail Capital said that the recent Tesla/GeoHot incident put a ""major dent"" in the technological mystique around Mobileye's name. It also said that GeoHot, Tesla's Autopilot and other developments raised questions about the viability of semi-autonomous driving, which Suhail said was likely to suffer setbacks or take the back seat to full autonomous road maps. Suhail said this would benefit competing technologies like LIDAR, high precision GPS and V2V communication, and Suhail said those technologies were already seeing ramping adoption at Mobileye's expense.

The Street Sweeper said Novatel was running into even more competition as it tried to expand overseas, where strong rivals controlled much of the market. The Street Sweeper concluded that Novatel's machine-to-machine service would not be enough to fill in the revenue gap of the company's overall ""fundamentally flawed business plan.""","Novatel is focusing on the MiFi system - a Wifi hot spot provided through a wallet-sized box that consumers on the go can use to access the Internet with their mobile gadgets.

Theyve been doing that for a long time. Its a brutal business. Its always been brutal, said a tech analyst who requested anonymity. The margins are terrible.

In fact, the product produces less than 11 cents to a little over 20 cents for each dollar sold. The margins improved last quarter  special thanks go to a $2.9 million inventory write-down and selling $2 million in old inventory at near cost.

Indeed, Novatel must hate having a bunch of its obsolete China-and-Thailand-made inventory sitting around. Yet it says increased competitive pressures may force more of these write-downs.

With these historically bad margins and declining revenue grabbing Novatel by the throat, some leaders wanted to sell the MiFi division last spring, according to sources.

The Street Sweeper noted that Miller Energy purchased certain abandoned assets in Alaska for $4.5 million, but held the value of those assets at more than $350 million on its books. The Street Sweeper questioned certain related party transactions, including dealings with Bristol Capital, and it said management compensation was excessive.","Before Miller Energy Resources (NYSE:MILL) purchased some abandoned assets in Alaska for $4.5 million  or barely half the price that its CEO paid for his sprawling Tennessee mansion  and then pegged the value of those assets at more than $350 million on its books, the company spent years fruitlessly trying to escape from the penny-stock arena through smaller deals that often wound up backfiring instead.

Those previous deals triggered serious legal disputes, with one of them crippling Miller for years and another  while touted as a huge victory for the company at the time  since quietly reversed this May on appeal. Miller could face potentially significant liabilities, far exceeding its modest cash resources, if the company fails to overcome that recent courtroom setback. Meanwhile, Miller has been slapped with a brand-new lawsuit  this one related to the Alaska deal itself  seeking piles of warrants for dirt-cheap stock from the company as well.

Despite that alarming track record, however, Miller has managed to convince investors that the company finally hit the jackpot  by snagging valuable assets that its previous owners (now bankrupt) initially could not sell  this time around.

Kerrisdale argued that investors were failing to recognize that the company's earnings in the first two quarters of the year were thanks to being on the rising side of an upgrade cycle and that returns in the fourth quarter or first quarter next were would be down sharply as most companies will have already updated their equipment. Kerrisdale said the company's product, with its considerably faster connection speed, was a premium product unnecessary for most businesses and was in many cases prohibitively expensive. Kerrisdale also said a comparison of the company's valuation to other companies in the market, along with Intel's impending entrance into higher speed connectivity technology, would push the stock price down considerably. n 1-25-2013, Kerrisdale Capital released a follow-up report, updating its arguments from four months before and arguing that the stock was still overvalued. Kerrisdale said falling revenue and guidances at the company were a sign that the company's revenue would continue to be below expectations, as evidenced by a loss of sellside support. Kerrisdale again noted competitive pressure coming soon from Intel and an ""increased uptake"" for a slightly slower but more cost effective connectivity technology from Broadcom.","But the high-technology semiconductor business is extremely cyclical and the ""alliances"" developed with the OEMs during Mellanox's temporary technological lead will count for little as competitors emerge.",Competitve Headwinds,Non-core operations masking growth;Strategy issues;Competitive headwinds;lackluster sales;business model pressure,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.",Nasdaq,fy2012,1,GV_176363,"Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.",IQ113918,Semiconductors,NasdaqGS:MLNX,117.054,500.275,111.951,302.593,157.736,23.868,419.647,157.736,0,56.8,342.539,35.019,59.8,85.35,0,43.318,138.31,-8.585,538.61,0,-19.436,105.983,0,3.43,58.275,118.879,0,4.424,0.803,0,153.119,119.242,0,769.33,0.896,182.489,37.431,120.138,-30.544,0,8.187,0,0,111.951,0,1.253,0,0,105.206,0,0,0,111.951,-250.879,2.835,0,-280.879,0,0,0,140.21,111.951,0,0,111.951,0,0.178,2.71015,0,137.783,2.71015,-0.918,0,41.308,-0.918,629.12,2.55,29.963,629.12,2.55,0,769.33,43.901,0,1.80416,0,1.6976,42065,41274,142.747,0,42.59626,142.747,34.186,42.97895,-64.204,(Invalid Formula 0me),118.879,14.76937,149.547,476.001,6.8,0,11.17471,74.52625,0.852,4.088,0,-0.918,1.253,6.8146,105.83338,2.835,0,105.83338,-415.559,0,-3.191,633.208,11.641,112.203,1112,-3.454,223

Later that day, in an interview with CNBC, Citron's Andrew Left said that Mallinckrodt's Acthar drug had missed sales estimates, which Left said indicated issues with the product's insurance reimbursement. Left said Mallinckrodt was having issues with reimbursement because Acthar did not have clinical data behind it, and Left also noted that Trudeau had misrepresented the true efficacy of the drug in his interview earlier that day.

Experts say apparent customer Sony may be using its $14.5 million MicroVision component purchase order as a way to spruce up its consumer electronics division for possible sale.

Sony's focus on iPhone sensors likely doesn't offer MicroVision an opportunity: Sony wanted only the MEMS component, and MEMS won't work with the smartphone.

The market for tiny projectors is tiny, and the average sales price is declining. A likely cancellable purchase order cannot fix those issues.

Iceberg Research discussed several examples where associate companies experienced significant declines to their market cap or had ""manufactured"" increased profits though ""questionable methods,"" yet Noble Group hid the impairments and failed to disclose the impact on its cash position. Iceberg Research stated it had no position, long or short, in Noble Group and promised more reports on the company in the future. On 2-16-2015, in a brief response shortly after the Singapore markets opened, Noble Group said it completely rejected Iceberg Research's allegations. On 2-17-2015, the company expanded further, stressing that its categorization of its investments had been ""clearly disclosed in our annual reports."" Noble Group said it had not misled the market, had done due diligence on its various transactions and been audited in priors years by Ernst & Young, which Noble said issued unqualified opinions. The same day, Bloomberg reported that the Monetary Authority of Singapore would review Iceberg's report and ""take appropriate action if there are breaches"" of the Securities & Futures Act.","Summary of Findings:
- Noble exploits the accounting treatment of its associates to avoid large impairments and
fabricate profit.
- Yancoal is the most representative example, with a gap of $600m between the carrying and
market values. However, the accounting technique has been used for other companies.
- Contrary to what Nobles management claims, the misfortunes of these associates have a
substantial cash impact on Noble.
- The proclaimed recovery of the Agri business in 2014 was manufactured through the use of
questionable methods such as subsidies from the group or depreciation cuts.
- We believe the final price for the new associate Agri will be much lower than the provisional
$1.5b payment; and/or that Noble will have substantial remaining financial commitments to
its new associate. Noble may once again use the accounting for associates to hide the
impairment.
- Selling the palm oil business will be very difficult for Noble since the licence of one of its
subsidiaries has been revoked by the local government.",Accounting Fraud,accounting fraud;cash shortage,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Noble Group Limited,Singapore,fy2015,0,GV_206897,Noble Group Limited,IQ2214129,Trading Companies and Distributors,SGX:CGP,1953.27,66712.404,-1672.01,358.455,64874.121,113.629,8495.498,64874.121,53.952,2492.928,1838.283,93.34,2847.978,1217.19,0,1791.52,0,1281.182,14595.755,0,519.396,1239.918,0,-3493.743,848.986,499.3,0,827.854,-174.333,0,331.843,41.47,0,17051.979,-1755.089,-235.531,3731.013,-1713.619,-87.19,559.912,-43.167,9.558,2175.262,-1670.452,-33.369,0,0,0,10319.699,0,0,3433.1,-1672.01,-147.499,0,24,-286.93,5.796,0,0,13754.117,-1696.01,9461.966,0,-1696.01,9461.966,216.36,-1.78737,0,1003.366,-1.78737,-7514.314,-102.075,948.8855,-7514.314,3292.066,-1.78737,0.063,3297.862,-1.78737,-102.075,17051.979,948.8855,0,0.02567,0,0.02567,42793,42369,612.929,-70.423,653.54096,328.44,1544.821,653.54096,1005.035,(Invalid Formula 0me),499.3,5.03728,1302.318,2960.223,689.389,230.396,4.52951,24.36075,33.665,6168.274,0,1947.652,2735.174,NM,-1674.8815,3433.1,NM,-1529.8815,-2327.224,136.799,1967.805,9466.136,-37.625,525.739,1500,-24.628,684

Muddy Waters said it could not trust management, and it included a report by behavioral analysis firm Qverity, which suggested that Noble management had been deceptive in addressing the recent accounting-related allegations from Iceberg Research. Muddy Waters said it found ""numerous red flags and aggressive actions by Noble"" in connection with Noble's 2013 purchase of PT Alhasanie. Muddy Waters said that Noble appeared to be in a vicious cycle whereby it would ""spend cash in value destroying ways in order to generate accounting gains,"" and it questioned whether the business would actually generate free cash flow if the company stopped growing its balance sheet. Muddy Waters said that if management was more transparent about its accounting, it could negatively impact Noble's credit rating.

Several hours after Muddy Waters released its report, Noble Group said in a short statement that it completely rejected the allegations in the report. The following day, Noble Group released a full response to the report.

On 5-14-2015, Carson Block of Muddy Waters said Noble Group had not become meaningfully transparent in response to reports from short-sellers and argued that if the company did, investors would quickly drop their shares. Block said the company had been on its radar for over a year before Iceberg's report had come out and characterized the campaign against Noble as not his fight. ","Muddy Waters is short Noble Group Limited (Noble). Noble seems to exist solely to
borrow and burn cash. According to Bloomberg, Noble has been free cash flow positive
only four out of 20 years  in other words, it literally generates positive free cash flow
once every five years!
1
 According to Bloomberg, since 1997 Noble has raised from
banks and markets net $7.7 billion. Nobles debt is now almost four billion dollars. (A
recent estimate, which Noble has not contested, is that due to repo-style transactions,
Nobles intra-quarter debt is approximately $3 billion greater than reported.2
)
Noble might encourage investors to exclude its working capital changes from
calculations of operating and free cash flow. We think that approach would be selfserving
and disingenuous. We are puzzled by why, when given a 20-year runway, this
company is still unable to stop burning cash. Really, what is the point of Noble growing,
if after all of this time, it still cannot consistently generate cash? We think Nobles
growth is a means to no end, other than to keep the credit flowing.
Noble depends on its income statement to survive. When a company borrows and burns
cash as consistently as Noble does, it needs to generate EBITDA for its lenders, and net
income for its equity investors (a companys ability to issue equity is comforting to
lenders). For a company such as Noble, with significant amounts of Levels 2 and 3 fair
value assets and an ever-expanding balance sheet, EBITDA and net income can be
relatively easy to produce. The key questions about Noble are:
 Is Noble effectively borrowing just to repay its existing debt? (In other words, if
Noble stopped growing its balance sheet, would the business actually generate
free cash and repay debt?)
 Is Noble in a vicious cycle whereby it will spend cash in value deThe reality of Nobles financial statements has recently been criticized by a supposed
former employee. 3 4 Recently released details on 2014 results suggest concerning
answers to the above questions. In 2014, 70% of Nobles net income came from
unrealized net gains on Level 3 assets.
5
 $2.1 billion of Nobles 2014 fair value gains are
on contracts maturing in over four years,6 which represents 30% of Nobles 2014 fair
value gains and 41% of shareholders equity.
7 With $4.0 billion in debt on Nobles
balance sheet and funding costs that have recently been volatile, the degree of substance
underlying Nobles financials is critical.
8

We are really short Nobles management. With a company as complex and opaque as
Noble, there is no way for investors to definitively answer the above questions. It
becomes a question of how much investors should trust Nobles management to be
straight with them. Nobles management has adamantly insisted that its accounting is
conservative, and by implication, is reflective of reality. We do not believe Nobles
management.stroying ways in

Shkreli explained that Lymphoseek did not demonstrate a documented advantage to the current standard of care. Shkreli also said that Lymphoseek's Phase III data set was very poor and seemed suspect, and he said that the drug would not win FDA approval. He added that were Lymphoseek to receive FDA approval, the best case pricing scenario for Lymphoseek would result in a 48% decline in Neoprobe's share price. He added that in the most likely case, Lymphoseek would be priced at 600% of generically available, off-label sulfur colloid and would take 10-15% of market share, which he said would result in a share price of $0.54.","The FDA will demand a real-world clinical trial for Lymphoseek. While its difficult to predict what the design of such a study will be, we suspect the FDA will enforce the truth standard requirement is does for all diagnostics. Lymphoseek is a generic sulfur colloid in my mind, with a very poor (and seemingly suspect) Phase III data set.

Because the market for colloids is so small, I dont see how Neoprobe is worth any more than $50 million, even if FDA approved.

Pearson accused John Thomas Financial of relentlessly promoting this stock on uninformed retail investors, which made up 81% of the stock's owners, including with overly aggressive cold calls by uninformed brokers. Because the company had no factory, product, revenue, and only ten employees, a 70% reduction in staff, Pearson argued the stock was significantly overvalued, especially with uncertainty over whether insurance would cover the explosion. John Thomas Financial touted the value of a subsidiary, Acasti, though Pearson highlighted that Acasti's main product was a phase II drug that would not complete phase III until 2015.

On 1-15-2013, the company confirmed that it would receive a first interim payment of $6 million from its insurer.

On 1-24-2013, the company announced that the COO position would be abolished for an interim period of time. Directors also took a 20% pay cut. (In his report, Pearson had gone out of his way to express that he had no criticism of the company's management.)

On 8-26-2013, the company announced that it received an additional payment from its insurers, bringing total recoveries to $11.7 million. It expressed seeking a total payout of $15 to $20 million total.","Neptune Technologies now has $0.70 per share in cash, but is planning to spend the majority of it in the coming year in an attempt to resurrect its business. Neptune has never generated a profit in its history and it currently has no factory, no product, no revenue and just 10 full-time employees.

After one and a half months, the company has still received no insurance monies and previous disclosure alerted investors to the fact that it may receive none.

Until the company receives and can provide clarity on its own survival prospects, the only justifiable value for the shares is a slight premium to its current cash per share value of $0.70.

The share price is currently being supported by buying, which has resulted from heavy promotional efforts and astronomical share price targets made by authors and John Thomas Financial who have either lacked any substantiation or who have cited facts about Neptune that are outright wrong.

When the promotion-driven buying stops, the share price can be expected to quickly find a level more reflective of its current value.",Overvalued by markets,stock promotion;credulous retail investors;hired stock promoters,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Neptune Technologies & Bioressources Inc.,Nasdaq,fy2012,1,GV_144382,Neptune Wellness Solutions Inc.,IQ2566068,Personal Products,TSX:NEPT,3.76527,19.1238,-1.92808,12.71131,9.06392,0.76398,16.47658,9.06392,0,7.04545,10.05988,3.44943,9.83636,11.89477,0,6.83291,3.9087,-2.89365,33.57622,0,-2.28799,13.90156,0,0.34338,7.55213,-5.73002,0,0,-0.25575,0,0.96829,-5.59268,-0.57077,44.73608,0,-7.24637,2.53142,-5.59268,-0.90735,1.92,-1,0,0.98233,-4.59268,0,0.00657,0,0,9.26681,0,-0.1183,2.83791,-1.92808,-9.0885,0.00736,0,-10.10024,4.85522,0,0,12.11208,-1.92808,1.29,0,-1.92808,1.29,45.84199,-0.04,0,-31.97331,-0.04,-0.95837,0,48.20545,-0.95837,27.76878,-0.04,15.88314,32.624,-0.04,0,44.73608,48.20545,0,-0.01724,0,-0.01724,41415,40968,-4.96604,0,49.68884,-4.96604,21.22143,49.68884,3.8048,(Invalid Formula 0me),-5.73002,0.55885,-4.74901,26.80049,0.21703,0.29946,0.53937,-0.83082,0,5.75417,0,0.33163,2.9089,NM,-3.66877,2.84527,0,-3.43152,-10.72241,0,3.03802,38.37817,0,-5.87339,105,-1,226

"," but we think theyre just gonna have to really pay up for streaming content.

We don't think that many potential additions exist.As noted earlier, Netflix's core business of renting DVDs to its customers depends on the First Sale Doctrine, which is coming under legal attack by content owners who argue (correctly, in our opinion) that it's inconsistent and unfair.

He said for NKTR-118 to gain market share, the drug would need to show a long duration of action, but that the Phase II primary endpoint was at just one week of therapy. Shkreli also negatively valued the rest of the company's pipeline, including its other Phase III drug, NKTR-102, and cited a lack of clinical data and sales potential. Shkreli said that in the absence of positive results for NKTR-118, he expected share price to fall 80%. He said that even if NKTR-118 succeeded, he estimated share price to fall 50%-80% given significant competition and a small market size.
","Shorting Nektar (NASDAQ:NKTR) is a good investment. There are material deficiencies with lead asset NKTR-118, which I believe will result in the failure of this drug to achieve Phase III clinical trial primary endpoints. In the absence of positive results for NKTR-118, Nektar is worth very little (~$1 per share). Even if NKTR-118 succeeds, I don't think NKTR stock is worth $8 per share.

NKTR-118 is a mu-opioid receptor antagonist constipation drug with seemingly positive phase 2 data in opioid-induced constipation (""OIC""). Phase 3 results will be reported in Q4 2012 and this is a significant binary event for the company. I believe these phase 3 studies will fail. The reason for this is the unreliability of mu-opioid antagonists in eliciting a robust anti-constipation duration of effect in clinical trials. ALKS 37, Entereg, CB-5945 and PTI-901, all opioid antagonists, have failed to show a durable effect in long-term studies of constipation. All of these drugs show good short-term effects on constipation, but no drug has a long duration of action. Some of these drugs are FDA approved and to gain any share, NKTR-118 needs to show long-term (12 week) alleviation of opioid induced constipation. The one drug in this class to show a robust long-term response is oral methylnaltrexone (Relistor). This drug will likely be FDA approved this year, and Nektar and AstraZeneca will be playing ""catch-up."" The lack of efficacy at the low dose of the Relistor study illustrates that constipation studies, in general, are difficult to achieve success with. It will be hard for NKTR-118 to differentiate from Relistor, if it succeeds in the forthcoming pivotal trials.",Product ineffective,drug overvalued;clinical trials mismanaged;competitive pressures;FDA approval unlikely,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,Nektar Therapeutics,Nasdaq,fy2012,1,GV_030137,Nektar Therapeutics,IQ29929,Pharmaceuticals,NasdaqGS:NKTR,25.437,81.191,-171.855,251.757,30.428,14.508,277.194,30.428,0,5.805,50.763,16.199,5.805,44.414,0,18.269,145.875,-0.867,314.631,0,-5.613,144.881,0,-0.122,72.215,-139.526,-9.384,0,-30.248,0,76.501,-169.774,0,497.79,-1.675,-129.756,2.863,-171.449,-10.583,0,0.406,0,0,-171.855,0,0,0,0,78.537,0,0,125,-171.855,148.603,11.607,0,113.02,0,0,0,450.772,-171.855,82.44,0,-171.855,82.44,0.011,-1.49673,0,-1570.38,-1.49673,-174.844,0,114.82,-174.844,47.018,-1.49673,4.117,47.018,-1.49673,0,497.79,114.82,0,-0.92413,0,-0.92413,42061,41274,-125.018,0,115.259,-125.018,26.801,115.28955,10.125,(Invalid Formula 0me),-139.526,0.40793,-122.218,-29.483,2.8,9.62,-0.2558,-106.10875,1.021,136.607,0,-92.404,0,NM,-71.985,136.607,0,-51.01875,-140.587,0,-16.061,183.625,0.893,-135.601,433,-0.487,227

Kerrisdale said the company did not offer unique technology, but had ""ridden the cloud computing wave"" to a price of $30/share off its IPO price months earlier of $18. Kerrisdale said the company's total market opportunity for IT Service Management was $1.5 billion, less than one-third of NOW's $4.7 billion market capitalization.","We believe that ServiceNow, Inc. (NOW or the Company) is highly overvalued. The Company was
taken public earlier this year at $18/share and has since ridden the cloud computing wave to a price of
$30/share, implying an eye-popping 18.3x 2012E revenue multiple. Even if ServiceNow becomes the
market leader and grows its share of the $1.5bn IT Help Desk market from the current 10%-15% to 30%,
we believe the stock is still worth less than half of its current trading price.
We have spoken to numerous industry professionals about ServiceNow and the IT Service Management
(ITSM) sector, and our research indicates that ServiceNow does not have a sustainable competitive
advantage over its numerous public and private peers. The Company has become a victim of its own
success by helping to galvanize a previously dormant industry to rapid innovation. NOW does not offer a
unique technology; rather, it merely introduced the SaaS business model to a sector where slow-moving
incumbents had frustrated certain segments of their customer base through cumbersome upgrades and
lumpy up-front costs. Its adoption of a SaaS solution, combined with an aggressive salesforce, helped
NOW gain market share at the expense of larger players.
Today, however, the competitive landscape is changing, with both incumbents and a slew of new
upstarts featuring SaaS offerings similar to NOWs products, and many at lower price points. The result
has been predictable: NOW's once enviable growth is rapidly decelerating. The first signs of this became
apparent when the company reported its third quarter earnings  NOW declined 12% after reporting
slowing growth in the third quarter and projecting further decelerating growth in the upcoming quarter.

The current observation is simply that the only thing more blistering than the pace of ServiceNow revenue growth has been the blistering pace of insider selling.

ServiceNow became public in July of 2012. In the 8 months since, insiders have already cashed out over $400 million in stock. This is excluding the amounts sold in the IPO itself. And the pace of selling continues to be brisk nearly every week, regardless of the share price.

Wall Street analysts (from the very banks who run ServiceNow's financings) are telling the rest of us to buy into the shares even at prices up to $43.00. Yet the insiders have demonstrated an eagerness to sell at prices of $28.00 and below. This has been the case even when these sales required a creative interpretation of the meaning of ""emerging growth company.""

History has shown that insiders know their own companies far better than Wall Street analysts. History has also shown that Wall Street analysts can find many reasons to upgrade and recommend stocks, while sellers typically have only one reason to sell big and sell early.",Overvalued by markets,insider selling;recent rally,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"ServiceNow, Inc.",NYSE,fy2013,1,GV_171007,"ServiceNow, Inc.",IQ22967487,Systems Software,NYSE:NOW,366.303,424.65,-73.708,268.251,155.259,24.152,634.554,155.259,0,108.339,269.391,65.581,108.339,256.98,0,0,78.678,-29.506,797.749,0,0,113.667,0,-0.252,75.56,-66.267,94.405,255.356,-2.445,0,14.52,-71.197,0,1168.476,0,81.746,7.405,-71.197,-55.321,0,2.511,0,0,-73.708,-13.33,0,0,0,328.088,0,0,414.777,-73.708,-333.967,0,0,-402.795,0,0,0,774.217,-73.708,562.941,0,-73.708,562.941,0.14,-0.54431,0,-179.196,-0.54431,0,0,135.41581,0,394.259,-0.54431,55.959,394.259,-0.54431,0,1168.476,135.41581,0,-0.3286,0,-0.3286,42425,41639,-42.115,0,140.35461,-42.115,568.57,141.1,247.314,(Invalid Formula 0me),-66.267,2.80902,-24.515,379.739,17.6,0,2.70557,-44.49813,0.92,414.777,0,562.941,0,NM,84.33488,414.777,0,83.02313,-219.777,0,-60.664,809.036,2.743,-97.436,1830,-0.232,328

Citron laid out evidence of this by interviewing Nu Skin sales representatives that work in China and described the multiple levels of the company's sales organization there. Citron also said evidence from conferences and the internet further confirmed a multi-level marketing campaign was being used.  Because multi-level marketing campaigns are illegal in China and because most of the company's new growth was occurring in China, Citron argued that ""the consequences would be devastating"" once the company had to halt its China operations.

The same day, the company put out a statement (though not a full press release) stating that it was ""in compliance with applicable regulations as interpreted and enforced by the government of China.""","Greater China comprised almost 75% of Nu Skin's year-over-year revenue growth in Q2. 
Greater China represented less than 10% of the companys revenue just 3 years ago, and is now 33.6%.
The average distributor in greater China purchased roughly $1,200 worth of product in Q2, almost triple that of the U.S. and double the average levels of prior periods in China.
The future of the company, and in particular, the growth story that underpins the value of its stock, is dependent on China.  As CEO Truman Hunt just stated ""Emerging markets, particularly China and South Asia, will continue to drive healthy overall growth rates""
Sales in North and South America contributed just 12 percent of revenue in the last quarter, with Europe just 7.7%. 
So the Chinese operation is contributing very materially to the companys overall financial results, particularly in shoring up its flagging growth in other regions.

Phase Five also said that ghost writers had promoted the company and its treatment on financial and cancer related websites, and it said that the company's CEO likely controlled an Israeli clinic providing unapproved DCVax treatments.

It also said that the CEO used $30 million of Northwest Biotherapeutics' cash for the benefit of her private company, and Phase Five noted other undisclosed transactions with a least one major shareholder and an independent director.","Phase Fives team analyzing NWBO was comprised of Phds and analysts with strong medical background, together
with financial experts with extensive background in uncovering fraudulent companies. We have studied NWBO
inside out, and below is a brief summary of our findings:
 Clinical development fiascos and forthcoming clinical failure. NWBO has been developing DCVax for 20
years now. According to NWBO, DCVax is a platform technology that uses activated dendritic cells (the
master cells of the immune system), and is designed to reinvigorate and educate the immune system to
attack cancer cells. We present in the second part of this report the data that shows why DCVax has very
little chance of succeeding in its ongoing glioblastoma trial;
 Ripping off minority shareholders. Powers and her companies (the Toucan Group) invested in NWBO
approx. $16 million of cash1
 since she first invested in NWBO in 2004 and her current holdings are
estimated at $150 million. Public shareholders have been less fortunate and have mostly been losing
money on NWBO as dilution followed dilution. This poses a mathematical challenge - how did a $16 million
investment turned into $150 million while the share price has mostly gone south? The answer is simple -
through related party transactions. NWBOs filings show that a significant portion of the proceeds from
shares issued to investors found its way to the Toucan Group, led by NWBOs contract manufacture
partner and R&D outsourcer  Cognate Bioservices Inc. Over the years, an astonishing amount of $310
million was transferred from NWBO to the Toucan Group in the form of cash, shares, warrants, options
and all kinds of other benefits. This totals to approx. 54% of the loss recorded by the company since

 Loans repaid by NWBO have been deducted from the calculation

4
Powers invested in it in 2004. In addition to this obscene wealth transfer, NWBOs financials disclose that
the company managed to spend another $115 million on R&D which was not paid to Powers company2
.
Since 2011, when NWBO started its Phase III trial, it recorded a total of $220 million of R&D costs. Based
on our experience with comparable Phase III clinical trial, the cost of such trials is between $30 and $60
million. In light of these finding, we believe Cognate has significantly over-charged NWBO for R&D
services, in addition to other baseless transfer of wealth from the company to the Toucan Group as we
will discuss in this report;
 Diverting cash and shares to CEOs private company. According to evidence we gathered, Powers and
her companies were cash-strapped for many years and had debts outstanding which prevented them from
from paying due taxes, let alone to continue investing in NWBO. In order to prevent dilution to Powers
companies and provide funds to Cognate, the following scheme was used:
 Instead of NWBO issuing shares to outside investors to raise funds and pay Cognate for R&D
services, Cognate and NWBO (both under common control of Powers) entered into an agreement
to convert invoices issued by Cognate to shares and warrants at a pre-agreed low price, causing
massive dilution to shareholders. As of June 2015, we estimate the result of this one-sided
agreement to be the issuance of approx. $81 million worth of shares and warrants to Cognate for
the settlement of $47 million of outstanding invoices. Cognate on the other hand, borrowed
money for its operations from third parties and settled the debt in shares of NWBO. This would
leave the difference between the price the shares were bought and the price the shares were sold
with Cognate instead of NWBOs shareholders, while not making it obvious to investors that
Powers has sold shares;
 Issuance of $21 million worth of shares and warrants to Cognate as an inducement to enter into
an agreement with NWBO;
 Issuances of shares with no consideration to Powers companies;
 Issuances of shares to third parties to cover Cognates debt with no consideration to NWBO; and
 Issuances of options to Powers personally upon her appointment as CEO, which at the time
equaled to approx. 10% of the issued and outstanding shares of the company.
 Corporate governance failure. This practice has not gone unnoticed. A Class action lawsuit has been filed
which sheds some light on the companys corporate governance and board of directors practices.
According to the claim, board of directors minutes provided by NWBO reveal that in many cases no
discussion was held about the transactions fairness to NWBO shareholders and no alternatives were even
considered or discussed;
 $5 million worth of securities transferred to a company incorporated by an analyst covering the share,
turned director. Our research has uncovered that Dr. Navid Malik, NWBOs 2012 nominated independent
director and member of its audit, compensation and nomination committee, released in 2010 a very
bullish research report on NWBO. Shortly after, a company he had just incorporated in Delaware received
approx. $5 million worth of shares and warrants of NWBO from Powers Toucan Fund II vehicle, shares

2
 Calculated based on NWBOs disclosures of related party transactions 
 October 28, 2015
5
that were subsequently sold by the company. Maliks involvement with NWBO prior to his nomination as
director has been concealed from investors and we question the legitimacy of this transaction and his
independence as a director;
 Transfer of patents to related parties without disclosure. NWBO transferred the majority of its patents
to an entity controlled by Powers in 2004 without any disclosure in its SEC filings. Powers transferred 6 of
the patents back to NWBO in 2012 only again to transfer a couple of days later 19 patents and applications
to a different major shareholder of the company without any disclosure in its SEC filings. Furthermore,
NWBO still claims in its current filing to own some of the patents it transferred years ago;
 Ghost writers promote the company and its treatment on financial and cancer related websites.
Previous publications have accused NWBO and its PR firms to have successfully used paid writers on
financial platforms and forums to promote the shares of the company. NWBO cannot promote the use of
DCVax as it has not been approved by the FDA. However, it is approved for compassionate (paid)
treatments in a very limited number of countries. NWBOs problem is that with the lack of clinical data,
oncologists do not usually recommend DCVax as an experimental treatment. We present additional
evidence that suggest that ghost writers work their way not only on financial forums and Twitter to
promote the company, but also on forums aimed at cancer patients, promoting the companys
unapproved treatment. If NWBO is found to be behind these ghost writers, we believe it will have severe
consequences, since it will not only arouse the interest of the FDA, but also the families of patients that
paid for the treatment and did not survive.
 We suspect Powers controls a clinic providing paid compassionate treatments of NWBOs unapproved
DCVax. We suspect that an Israeli medical center (the International Center for Cell Therapy & Cancer
Immunotherapy, or CTCI) that has been selling NWBOs unapproved DCVax treatment to terminally ill
patients for hundreds of thousands of dollars may be indirectly owned by Powers and her companies. In
addition, NWBO refers GBM patients to get the unapproved paid treatment from CTCI in Israel, outside
of the companys clinical trial, as the treatment is not approved in the US. To top that, CTCI was accused
by the Israeli Health Ministry of running unapproved experiments in humans and has been unwilling to
provide information on these treatments requested by the Ministry. NWBOs financial statements do not
provide enough disclosure to verify that these payments by patients have actually been transferred to
NWBO.
 Use of NWBO cash for the benefit of NWBOs CEO private company. We believe Powers used $30 million

The Street Sweeper said the company needed to raise more funds to keep going, in part to pay its bills for past clinical trials and also to resolve several class-action lawsuits related to NWBO issuing misleading press releases.","This is just the latest in a series of stunning negatives, including:

*1. Cash has plummeted to just $3.2 million.

*2. Cash burn hit ~$17 million.

*3. Working capital deficit soared to $86 million.

*4. CEO Linda F. Powers company bio doesnt mention it, but Ms. Powers was Enrons senior vice president for global operations, though she wasnt implicated in the scandal. She controls NWBOs major funding sources Toucan Capital and Toucan Partners, holders of ~4% of outstanding shares.

*5. Expensive lawsuits have gone in NWBOs favor and against it, such as a class-action securities lawsuit alleging the company issued misleading press releases. NWBO agreed to settle for $1 million. NWBO has also received demand letters from shareholders seeking access to books with the intention of investigating possible mismanagement and breaches of fiduciary duty. One demand has been settled, two more remain under discussion.

*6. Market value is $760 million. With just 12 full-time employees, the company last year spent $85.6 million in R&D and $16.9 million in general and administrative costs.

*7. Extremely promising competing therapeutics are undergoing testing by Stanford and numerous companies.

*8. Serious doubts exist about NWBOs survival, according to its SEC filings:

Because of recurring operating losses, net operating cash flow deficits, and an accumulated deficit there is substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.

*9. NWBOs 10-K filing warns: We will need to raise substantial funds, on an ongoing basis

Indeed, it adds: Any financing will involve issuance of equity and/or debt, and such issuances will be dilutive to existing shareholders.

He said the company's main drug, Squalamine, had been purchased for almost nothing from another company because it was clearly a commercial failure.

Pearson disclaimed having any position in OHRP in the piece.","A recent report from Vista Partners sent OHRP soaring by 60%.

Ohr stock had just collapsed to as low as $6.86 due to a recent failure of its drug in clinical trials.

Squalamine was previously owned by Genaera Pharma. The drug had already failed following clinical trials such that Genaera sold it to Ohr for less than $100,000.

Recent encouraging results from Ohr were actually reported by Genaera as early as 2003, but the drug was still discarded as unviable.

Pearson also noted that the company's Phase II and Phase III drugs had been offloaded, placed on hold or discontinued. Pearson predicted that the company would issue shares to continue funding operations since it continued to burn through cash and shouldered $30 million in debt. He estimated 40-50% downside.","Omeros recently spiked on release of new Phase II drug data for OMS-721.

The stock quickly gave up almost all of these gains once the details of this trial were better understood.

Omeros had previously been hitting a new 52-week low of $11.93 due to the failed launch of its only commercial product, Omidria. But shares appeared to be headed lower.

Omidria continues to fail and the share price should retrace to well below $11.00. Ultimately, the stock should settle around $6-8.

Omeros desperately needs to raise money in the near term via an equity offering any day now. This is the near-term catalyst for a sharp decline. The first conclusion is that all in all there should have been nothing to get too excited about with the release of data from OMS-721.

Concurrent with its reverse merge, the company was able to raise $6.5 million.
ONVO was beginning to attend investor conferences. With such a ""great technology"" and relationship with two behemoth pharma companies (PFE, UTHR), why did the company choose a reverse merger transaction to go public, rather than an IPO transaction?
We consider the collaborative investment to be peanuts ($688,000 in 2011). While it is great that reputable firms have allotted funds toward ONVO, in the scheme of things this amount is such a small nut for these large companies.
The majority of the 2011 reported revenues came from what we consider potentially non-operating sources (collaborations and grants). Pure product revenue was a mere $223 thousand.
The meaningful commercialization of ONVO's technology from a revenue view point seems to be well into the future and would probably require a constant amount of funding.

He noted the ""onset"" of selling by insiders, the signaling effect of 45 million new shares issued in just January, the overhang from convertible bond shares issued to acquisition targets, and no expectation by the company of being profitable in the near future. Pearson said positive attention from CNBC's Jim Cramer, a notable short squeeze and bullish forecasts had propelled the stock, but it would now correct itself. He said the CEO's purchase of a ""negligible"" number of shares was simply to signal further gains to the market and maintain the high stock price. Pearson argued that the company's prostate cancer screening test was not as revolutionary as was being stated by other analysts and that its potential market was 70-90% lower than was predicted. On 4-9-2013, Pearson released a follow-up article, noting a coming insider cliff because Prost-Data, a holder of 7 million shares, could begin selling their shares on 4-18-2013 and could do so at a nearly 70% gain. He noted a total of 37 million shares worth $300 million held by non-management insiders that had all made ""tremendous paper gains.""

Pearson repeated his arguments behind the stock's high valuation and stock purchasing strategy by its CEO.","Heavy share issuance by Opko: Opko has been taking advantage of the run-up in the share price to issue 20 million shares for its acquisition of Cytochroma at $4.87 and another 25 million shares via a convertible bond at $7.07. Revenue forecasts from bullish authors seem to have significantly overestimated the revenue potential for Opkos drugs and its 4KScore product. For example, authors are consistently predicting that expected revenues from numerous drugs will exceed those of the best selling drugs of all time for the entire industry. With 4K, authors are assuming the the test will sell for triple the price and immediately capture 50% of the market. In December Opko closed its acquisition of Prost-Data Inc (OURLab) based out of Nashville. One week later Opko announced that it had acquired Silcon Comércio of Brazil.

The Street Sweeper said the company's stock was recently pushed up by a misleading announcement that the company entered into a long-term agreement with Samsung. The Street Sweeper noted that PANL would not receive royalty payments from the deal, according to the actual contract, despite the implication in the press release that it would. The Street Sweeper noted that Manuel Asensio sent a letter to the SEC criticizing the disparity between the press release and the actual contract filed in an 8-K, although Asensio did not hold a short position in PANL at the time.

On 12-3-2011, The Street Sweeper published a second report on PANL. The Street Sweeper said the company's patents were weak, and that Philips Electronics would likely prevail in challenging one of PANL's patents.
On 12-15-2015, The Street Sweeper said that OLED's fundamental patent was scheduled to expire in 2017 and that its other patents faced an expiration date of 2018 and later. The Street Sweeper added that as OLED's key patent expired in December 2017, the company's ""most significant"" commercial license agreement with Samsung would also expire. The Street Sweeper also noted that the rumor that Apple was considering organic light-emitting diode technology (OLED) did not mean that Apple would necessarily invest in panels from OLED, as it said that Apple could instead consider other competitors such as DuPont, Sumitomo Chemical, EMD or BASF.","PANL had by then spent more than a year simply extending its original contract with Samsung, its largest commercial customer by far, collecting royalty payments for use of patented technology that ranks as the smaller companys primary asset. While Goldman Sachs and other bullish followers of the stock widely expected a jump in that royalty rate under a renegotiated deal, however, PANL ultimately revealed that the company would no longer receive royalty payments from the giant cell phone maker at all. PANL insiders have capitalized on that surge with lucrative stock sales, banking $9.5 million since the company first announced its new contract with Samsung five short weeks ago.By now, the leaders of PANL  including Chairman Sherwin Seligsohn, CEO Steven Abramson and CFO Sidney Rosenblatt -- have already stained their records with one notable failure in the technology space.

On 4-30-2010, Shareholder Watchdog commented on Pacific Capital's earnings announcement and capital plan initiatives, and it said that first quarter results were significantly worse than expected. Shareholder Watchdog added that the bank dropped below the threshold for ""well capitalized,"" and that non-performing assets increased 7% sequentially and 72% year-over-year.

Muddy Waters tweeted that the company had exaggerated its total addressable market and fudged organic growth, and it said that the company faced competition eroding pricing power and heavy insider sales. 

In Muddy Waters' 56-slide presentation, Carson Block said that Proofpoint's management mis-characterized the company as a cyber security company, but Block said that Proofpoint only focused on email security and archiving. He added that email security was a smaller and more mature market, and Block said that the number of business emails might actually be shrinking and that spam might be decreasing. Block also said that Proofpoint's 2013 estimate of $400 million for the total addressable market for ""Targeted Attack Protection"" was a substantial overstatement, and he additionally said that the company's 2018 total addressable market of $2.9 billion was disingenuous. Block added that Proofpoint had fudged organic growth and that its management consistently represented acquisitions as contributing little revenue. He also said that the company's growth rate was at risk due to increasing competitive pressures from Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Cisco, and he said that migration to cloud email was not good for market share.

The 3D printing industry attracts top talent, and they are paid pretty well.

Citron said it read The Street Sweeper's article in January and then filed some Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to further explore the company. Citron said Questcor's Acthar was a 60-year-old drug that was highly vulnerable to competitive threats. On 11-25-2013, Citron revived its campaign, arguing that the company's acquisition of Synacthen was anticompetitive, and it noted that the FTC was investigating the matter. On 12-3-2013, Citron commented on suspicious acts it believed Questcor had taken to cover up its connection to Synacthen.","Questcor is not a normal pharma company; it is exclusively a sales
channel for a single high-priced drug: HP Acthar Gel; no more, no less. The company has no other pipeline, no other drug candidates, and no material R&D investment in any other pharma
products. If Acthar had a sustainable future, it would be reasonable to hang a multiple on the stock. But if, as our story outlines, the glory days of its exploitive strategy are numbered, the stock valuation should reflect the many landmines the company has to tiptoe through, the detonation of any one of which will savage its valuation .

Later in the day, Questcor defended its marketing and business practices. On 1-16-2012, Questcor said it had a phone conversation with The Street Sweeper's Melissa Davis. The company publicly provided answers to several questions The Street Sweeper had privately posed to the company a week earlier. On 1-24-2012 and 1-27-2012, The Street Sweeper published its two-part report on Questcor. The Street Sweeper suggested that the company was illegally marketing its Acthar treatment for off-label disorders, and it also questioned how effective the drug was. The Street Sweeper noted that the company originally acquired the rights to Acthar for just $100,000 in 2001 after its previous owners abandoned it.","By capitalizing on its high price (raised 1,300% literally overnight) and its broad label (approved in 1952 based on its perceived safety alone), Questcor hopes to transform Acthar into a true blockbuster drug. Questcor views Acthar as a full-blown pipeline, in fact, relying on that single medication for virtually all of its current revenue and its forecasted growth as well. But former Questcor insiders, who resigned from the company over ethical concerns, tell a radically different story. As recently as last summer, they say, Questcor operated no compliance program  and offered no compliance training for its employees  at all. Rather, they say, Questcor allowed its hard-driving sales division to call the shots instead. It was anything for a referral. I heard that multiple times, says an industry veteran who resigned from the company last year. The attitude there was: Were small. Were under the radar. And until we get caught, were going to do anything we want. Former Questcor insiders point to Chief Business Officer Steve Cartt as the driving force behind that attitude. If nothing else, records indicate, Cartt has certainly raised some eyebrows with his lucrative stock sales. Last year, with Questcor celebrating the NS market as a powerful new source of revenue, Cartt struck it rich by dumping more than $15 million worth of the companys highflying shares.

Ikarian estimated that 50% of its revenues were generated as a direct result of its relationship with CDF, and Ikarian suggested that if the relationship were modified or canceled, EPS could get cut by 60%. On 7-17-2014, Ikarian said in a new report that a ""real safety study"" was needed to protect patients after hundreds of adverse events were associated with Acthar. Ikarian questioned the value of Questcor to MNK.","Questcor (QCOR) is another company with some questionable dealings and it is already being investigated by the U.S. Attorney General's Office in Pennsylvania. n particular, we question the manner in which Questcor conducts its free drug program in conjunction with the Chronic Disease Fund. The fact that these co-pay assistance payments are growing at such a rapid rate, up 200% Y/Y ($11.3m the past four quarters) and up 65% Y/Y in the most recent quarter ($3.2m), indicates that Questcor is increasingly relying on these sorts of programs to boost sales. What Questcor does not say is that they are also increasingly relying on their free drug program to direct patients to the CDF and its affiliates. Questcor's actions would also seem to indicate that they are equally determined to see that its relationship with the CDF does not see the light of day.

The Emperor said that the company faced negative attention for its involvement in funding terrorism, and it questioned whether the company was also dealing with U.S. sanctioned entities. The Emperor also said that QIWI had a limited history of compliance with regulatory requirements and that its compliance standards were not comparable to Paypal's requirements. The Emperor added that QIWI could face a hefty hit to operations through a combination of legal fees, an operational halt or a significant investment in adequate infrastructure.","The New York Times broke news linking QIWI as one of the main methods of choice used to crowdfund the war in Ukraine involving Russia.

QIWI clearly notes its inability to comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules - the very same rules that prevent funding of terrorism. This places QIWI's business in jeopardy.

Are QIWI insiders aware of its dirty little secret? Insiders plan to sell over $150 million of stock (12% of the company) in the open market shortly.

Is the company also dealing with U.S. sanctioned entities? Operations could be meaningfully impacted or shutdown if so. Are QIWIs compliance standards comparable to a key competitor? Nope.

QIWI has a limited history of compliance with regulatory requirements; the company has skirted too close to the line on many fronts and it seems the music is about to stop.

The Street Sweeper said regulations concerning how much federal debt students at for-profit colleges could take out would hurt the colleges and, in turn, QuinStreet, which gathered information for many for-profit colleges. The Street Sweeper also said changes in Google's search algorithms were depressing QuinStreet's information gathering websites. With 60% of QuinStreet's revenue coming from just 20 customers, The Street Sweeper concluded that these regulatory developments and algorithm changes at Google could put the company's business model in jeopardy.","QNST's clients face major issues beginning with President Obamas plan to make community colleges free.

QNST's client Corinthian College filed for bankruptcy last week, intensifying the for-profit college industrys collapse. Two others also knuckled beneath federal regulators allegations that they plunged low-income students into debt.

Remaining potential clients may get weeded out when federal regulations kick in on July 1. Career colleges will lose out on federal aid money unless students are prepared for gainful employment.

QNSTs Financial Services division is also at risk as Google pressures QNST. At the same time, QNST is being forced to increase media spend and watch its customers turn into competitors.

Credit Suisse reiterates underperform and $4 price target. It noted QNSTs risk of just 20 customers creating over 60 percent of revenue, and expects gross margin of 10.9% in 2015. Attorneys general from 20 states investigated QuinStreet's ""GIBill.com"" and contended that misleading, false and deceptive elements fooled veterans who clicked on the site believing it was associated with the US Department of Veterans Affairs. They charged that the schools QuinStreet listed were the only ones where students could use their military education benefits. That was not the case. QuinStreet must buy traffic, especially as Google algorithm changes damage traffic, customers become competitors. QuinStreet has a history of operating losses extending through 2013.

If and when the full report is made public, we will update this page.","RDENs dependence on celebrity fragrances comes at a terrible time, when the over-saturated fragrance industry is shifting to designer brands and quality over celebrity names.
We believe that many of the licenses that RDEN owns for fragrances are for celebrities and designers whose peak fame is years behind them.
Removing the value of questionable intangible assets on the companys balance sheet reveals it may be much closer to an insolvency scenario than the numbers make it look.
Recent filings and an S&P downgrade of the companys debt could be forecasting more tumultuous results when RDEN reports in mid-August.
Based on the average of numerous valuation scenarios, we believe RDEN shares could have 52% downside, alongside risk of a bankruptcy/insolvency scenario.

Pearson said the acquisition amounted to ""buying a lottery ticket,"" hoping that Syntroleum's technology would prove more profitable.","If REG knows that its stock is likely to fall by 50%-70%, then it is really paying around $15 million for these assets, which actually seems like a fair price.

As with Gevo, REG management is being smart. If REG management were to wait even two more weeks, the tax credit will expire and the share price is likely to head below $5.00 immediately. This would clearly make the purchase of the idled and unproductive assets far too expensive for REG to consider.

It cautioned investors from ""overstaying their welcome."" A few days later Copperfield stated it was still working on new analysis.

On 6-17-2013, Copperfield Research released its full report, saying SolarCity Corporation stock's was significantly overvalued due to accounting manipulation, a lack of disclosure and hyper bullish assumptions about sales and customer renewal rates. Copperfield said the company's assumption of 90% customer renewal in years 21-30 of solar leases and a 6% discount rate gave the company a ""materially inflated"" net present value. Copperfield also argued that the company was overstating the fair market value of its projects to benefit even more from Department of Treasury 1603 grants than was warranted and noted IRS audits and a Treasury Inspector General subpoena in relation to the issue. Once project costs were closer to their actual value and, even more importantly, when the government provided less support for solar projects, Copperfield said the company would struggle to maintain its current sales levels. Copperfield said the company's model was already fraying and that return on capital in the first quarter would yield a negative 18.1%. ","As we discuss at length in our report, we believe SolarCity's business does not at all resemble the story that the day traders and retail investors believe. We show pervasively aggressive accounting and non-GAAP, black box contrived metrics that should remind any experienced investor of metrics like ""eyeballs."" SolarCity has many other problems besides simply attaining an egregious valuation through a fanciful story. In our opinion, SolarCity has also misrepresented its financial profile, changing key assumptions underlying net present value (NYSE:NPV) without explicitly disclosing these changes to investors. The NPV uses a preposterous discount rate of only 6%, while management has also insincerely tried to convince investors that their immature credit is on par with mortgage and utility credits (a utility turns off your electricity if you don't pay how does SolarCity centrally turn off your electricity without a truck roll and how do they repo a system cost effectively?). Additionally, we will analyze third party data that seems to unequivocally conclude that SolarCity has been fleecing tax payers by overstating the fair market value (NYSE:FMV) of systems that are used to determine 1603 Treasury grants. We are not calling SolarCity's business model a Ponzi Scheme built on tax payers, but we do believe that the current IRS audits and Treasury Inspector General subpoenas could create a significant risk for SolarCity's reputation, financials (with undisclosed, off-balance sheet potential liabilities), and shareholders. In an extreme case, we believe SolarCity's own S1 liability example, could imply an off-balance sheet, undisclosed liability of as much as $153 million (this would be a 45% FMV overstatement which is not our base case). There are of course other flags such as selective disclosure, SEC financial filings that do not reconcile with press releases and investor presentations, and public statements that we believe are materially incorrect.",Accounting Fraud,accounting misrepresentation;industry saturation;competitive headwinds;failure to disclose material adverse information;unsavory management,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,SolarCity Corporation,Nasdaq,fy2013,1,GV_015314,"Tesla Energy Operations, Inc.",IQ29053039,Semiconductors,-,577.08,163.837,-55.79,0,124.468,41.448,577.08,124.468,0,23.011,39.369,21.262,43.242,185.827,0,111.394,1.52,2.911,787.663,0,-19.954,41.146,0,50.75,22.407,-147.978,233.635,0,-25.738,0,278.169,-174.851,0,2809.534,-1.706,174.515,121.556,-176.557,-726.073,0,-24.799,0,10.577,-151.758,-3.826,31.014,0,0,338.206,0,0,518.392,-55.79,0,105.631,0,-729.899,231.526,0,0,1960.41,-55.79,534.86,0,-55.79,534.86,0.01,-0.69928,0,-202.326,-0.69928,-109.919,0,79.78198,-109.919,617.598,-0.7,197.662,849.124,-0.7,0,2809.534,79.78198,0,-0.16688,0,-0.16688,42410,41639,-106.53,0,91.009,-106.53,972.384,91.50367,417,(Invalid Formula 0me),-147.978,6.78612,-92.73,339.429,13.8,6.603,3.72962,-13.31388,-1.726,665.614,0,424.941,41.591,NM,-709.4275,624.023,0,-693.34125,88.534,0,-62.508,1514.738,0.116,-832.603,4262,-24.915,348

We believe Stonegate Mortgage investors will suffer significant losses as many issues we identify play out. We have well-researched reservations about the viability/sustainability of its business model.

We believe management changed definitions for adjusted earnings without appropriate disclosures, and excluded recurring expenses (that don't reconcile). Both appear violations of SEC reporting guidelines (Reg G).

Stonegate continues to raise capital on overstated projections and an MSR mark 32% higher than its peers. Sellside estimates have declined nearly 50% in eight months.

Holdings. The retail business is truly dreadful and we are believers that we should own good retailers
who accumulate some of their real estate (e.g. Tesco, Target) rather than bad retailers on a
liquidation premise. But we have never really had a case to go short the stock either.
But Sears results have been particularly dreadful; its credit rating got downgraded to deep junk.
Moreover, a short position in it is negatively correlated to our remaining reflation bets (Citigroup,
BofA) and negatively correlated to our one US property owning retailer (Target).
This correlation is extremely strong through the balance sheet of the above-mentioned fund. They
own 16.2 million Sears shares  and average trading volume is only about 650 thousand. If the
reflation bets continues to fail then there is at least one huge forced seller of Sears stock. It would be
very hard to liquidate a position so large. So our guess is that in that adverse scenario Sears stock
would be hit very hard. So we shorted a little Sears (now about 1 percent of the portfolio).
If the American reflation bet succeeds we will lose money on the Sears position  but we do not
think we lose a lot because the retailer is truly dreadful. It looks like a good natural hedge in the
event that we continue to be wrong on the reflation bet. We like natural hedges  we collect them.",Overvalued by markets,business model pressure;debt default risk;lackluster product and sales,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Sears Holdings Corporation,Nasdaq,fy2011,1,GV_006307,Sears Holdings Corporation,IQ7675730,Department Stores,OTCPK:SHLD.Q,1359,42664,133,0,30988,859,1359,30988,10,689,11676,0,689,10411,46,8951,0,0,11560,859,-353,11329,0,-285,7102,406,0,0,-257,-34,4385,135,-15,24360,31,123,3046,166,-426,360,27,35,489,139,0,0,11,0,8643,0,0,2344,133,0,0,0,-406,103,-36,35,15746,133,1353,0,122,1388,1,1.19283,0,4930,1.09417,-358,-5826,111.5,-358,8511,1.18848,0,8614,1.09,-394,24360,111.7,0,0.60426,0,0.60318,41353,40572,1265,0,109,1265,-95,108.74237,-321,(Invalid Formula 0me),406,78.08257,2078,4126,813,164,37.85321,67.375,47,3193,-1.3,1030,849,16.265,-124.375,2344,0,58.75,1834,0,637,11807,104,839,312000,-77,146

On 10-30-2013, Copperfield published a follow-up report, commenting on the company's recent earnings.

On 2-7-2014, Copperfield said it was unlikely that Pepsi would partner with SodaStream. (Two days earlier, Coca-Cola had agreed to a partnership with SodaStream competitor Green Mountain Coffee Roasters.)
","Several months ago, we shared our opinion that SODA was buying its Italian distributor to provide a revenue and EBITDA boost through accounting shenanigans. Simplistically, SODA previously made sales into its channel, recognizing revenue. Then, they bought the distributor, assumed the inventory, and could re-sell the product, effectively recognizing sales two times on the same product. We believe this accounting treatment was the same methodology used in the past when SODA bought its Nordic distributor. Recall, on its Q2'13 earnings call, when management casually announced they had bought their Italian distributor, the company guided for a minimal impact from the transaction. To be precise, SODA guided for the transaction to add ""$2 million"" of sales in the second half of 2013. Also, they confessed (or blamed) that they had assumed $10 million of Italian inventory from the distributor they acquired.

The Street Sweeper said Sportsman's was facing stiff competition from other gun retailers, falling demand across the industry, and a gun market over-filled with inventory, forcing the company to offer ever larger discounts on its most profitable products. The Street Sweeper also criticized the company's growth strategy, arguing that the towns SPWH had expanded into did not have a rich enough or big enough customer base to achieve a healthy return for its stores.
","Summary

Sportsman's Warehouse has already gone bankrupt once, and with so little cash and so much debt on its balance sheet, could easily go broke down the road yet again.

The company has tried to compensate for a persistent decline in same-store sales by expanding into new markets that, in some cases, arguably make no business sense.

Hurt by falling demand for the guns and ammo that account for roughly half of its sales, SPWH entered the crucial holiday season with record-high levels of unsold merchandise.

Forced to compete with rivals offering big holiday promotions, SPWH has slashed prices on some of the most profitable merchandise that it sells.

SPWH better hope that last-minute holiday shoppers responded, since a random visit to one of its stores two weeks before Christmas seemed to spell serious trouble.",Strategy,cash shortage;debt default risk;overinvestment by company;strategy issues,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Sportsmanâs Warehouse Holdings, Inc.",Nasdaq,fy2014,1,GV_016009,"Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings, Inc.",IQ23037669,Specialty Stores,NasdaqGS:SPWH,1.354,643.163,21.75,0,435.933,6.277,1.354,435.933,0,0.413,207.23,0.365,3.646,144.809,0,161.334,0,1.052,176.316,0,-28.344,44.56,0,1.333,31.494,62.421,0,0,-25.447,-12.416,7.535,36.974,0,224.229,-2.386,0.034,27.664,34.588,-20.416,5.696,12.838,0.124,30.912,21.75,-47.767,0,0,0,93.1,0,0,229.272,21.75,0,0,0,-68.059,0,-2.331,5.696,345.325,21.75,264.052,0,21.75,269.748,0.33,0.65571,0,-121.791,0.65571,-128.619,0,33.17,-128.619,-121.096,0.65571,0,-121.096,0.65571,-0.302,224.229,33.185,0,0.69668,0,0.69636,42453,41671,68.698,-101.065,27.265,68.698,32.864,41.2752,-35.161,(Invalid Formula 0me),62.421,-4.44145,95.816,-128.631,27.118,0,-4.71781,23.10875,23.089,265.88,-3.7,141.129,36.608,37.1169,-56.29425,229.272,464.6666,-47.34188,264.526,25.447,72.581,144.784,10.669,48.282,1500,2.169,518

Later in the day, STB responded that there were no plans to change its dividend program, and it said there were no material or adverse changes in the company's normal business plans or activity.","STB Cannot Support its Dividend w/out Continuous Dilution
? From 2007-2011, STB generated free cash flow of just $21m, while paying $120m of
dividends and repurchasing $15m of 100% mgmt owned Series B stock
? Significantly dilutive equity and convertible debt financings have been used to fund the
dividend gap; $180m of equity has been raised, causing the share count to balloon by 33%
per annum, which further exacerbates the dividend burden
? Based on our analysis, STBs free cash flow will not cover its dividend again in FY 2013,
placing the dividend at severe risk of being cut and potentially pushing the stock price
toward our fair value estimate, ~70% below current levels
Debt-Fueled M&A Benefiting Management, Not Shareholders
? School bus industry has largely been consolidated by competitors in the past
10 yrs leaving many small, independent operators of lower quality as targets
? STBs acquisition strategy provides no synergies, is driving top-line revenue growth, with
no improvement in EPS and limited free cash flow improvement without sacrificing critical
capital expenditures
? Management bonuses tied primarily to revenue growth vs. EPS growth metrics used by
peers, resulting in misaligned incentive structure to grow revenues at any cost; significant
goodwill accumulation indicates possible overpayments
STBs Capacity to Raise New Capital Appears to Be Hitting a Wall
? STB listed its shares on the Nasdaq in 2011 after trading for years in Canada. Based on its
business model, we believe the company needed a new venue to issue more stock; STB
quickly issued C$75m of stock to pay down debt, as it had no excess cash flow to reduce
debt, pay the dividend, and support its high capex needs
? STB has almost no institutional investor support; ~66% of the stock is held by retail
investors. STBs capacity for finding new retail investors may be limited
Significant Overvaluation to Peers and Underlying Asset Value
? STBs valuation at 11.5x EV/EBITDAR is a significant premium to transportation deal values
of 5.0x  7.0x; the companys EV/Vehicle for its 9,000 vehicles is $87,000 vs. ~ $75,000 for
the cost of a brand new school bus
? Conclusion: We believe STBs shares are worth no more than $2.00 and that they are at
risk of a precipitous decline in the absence of the continued dilution that appears
necessary to support its dividend",Overvalued by markets,dividend unsustainable;dumb money;strategy issues,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,Student Transportation Inc.,Nasdaq,fy2012,1,GV_163692,Student Transportation Inc.,IQ13239506,Trucking,-,5.013,368.986,2.254,0,271.226,40.586,5.013,271.226,-6.925,36.422,97.76,3.619,38.528,38.455,0,3.296,0,3.577,61.216,37.149,0,371.188,3.437,-1.025,226.736,15.1,0,0,-15.327,0,217.281,-5.547,0,521.8,5.709,34.91,0.963,0.162,-48.616,0,-2.092,0.999,0.575,2.254,-60.934,0,0,0,39.078,0,0,215.417,2.254,0,0,0,-109.451,3.231,-0.886,0,310.751,2.254,202.508,0,2.254,202.508,404.857,0.03408,0,-191.319,0.03408,-175.247,0,66.1394,-175.247,207.818,0.03,79.606,211.049,0.03,-2.142,521.8,75.13333,0,-0.05242,0,-0.04614,41534,41090,55.686,-28.302,75.91032,55.686,75.649,75.91032,1.301,(Invalid Formula 0me),15.1,2.73768,76.886,-9.463,21.2,13.784,-0.12466,-3.46688,1.789,215.992,0,27.261,0.575,NM,-1.90988,215.417,1255.6344,5.9475,210.979,15.327,-0.921,427.041,2.247,7.07,0,-4.339,243

He argued that StoneMor had given out more as a dividend than it had as an operating cash flow, and so eventually investors would no longer support a stock price based on such a large dividend. He also noted a lack institutional or insider investors, junk ratings at rating agencies, a lack of profitability, and being near to breaching debt covenants as concerns for StoneMor going forward.","StoneMor continues to be unprofitable and generate insufficient cash flow to pay its dividend. StoneMor continues to tap the debt and equity markets for ever larger sums in order to continue paying an above market dividend. As a result, its share count and debt obligations have continued to expand over the years.

StoneMor's continued publication of the ""distributable free cash flow"" has confused some retail investors into believing that the company does have adequate cash flow to pay its huge 9% dividend. However the SEC has already disallowed that methodology for computing cash flow.

Paying out an enormous 9% dividend has now become quite obviously unsustainable. As the investor base continues to expand, the payment obligations expand exponentially creating the need to continually raise ever larger amounts of new money from more and more investors. StoneMor has now disclosed that it is now dangerously close to breaching debt covenants (within 1%).

As with the Whiting Trust, StoneMor is likely to fall by 30-50% as soon as investors decide to exit.

As with Whiting, the catalyst for this move is not dependent upon StoneMor cutting the dividend in advance.

Now that the stock has gone ex-dividend and earnings have been announced, there is simply no reason to continue holding the stock. The best move is to exit and eliminate the 30-50% downside risk before other sellers act first.",Overvalued by markets,cash shortage;debt covenant breach;debt default risk,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,StoneMor Partners L.P.,NYSE,fy2013,1,GV_160207,StoneMor Partners L.P.,IQ9620336,Specialized Consumer Services,NYSE:STON,12.175,255.526,-20.511,0,120.847,9.548,12.175,120.847,-2.685,55.415,134.679,1.37,55.415,109.631,0,5.4,0,-8.834,93.879,9.548,0,452.872,0,8.145,401.476,4.605,68.454,0,-21.07,0,58.392,-16.465,-4.075,1474.343,-6.649,35.077,37.269,-23.114,-12.752,0,-3.514,0,2.916,-19.6,-14.1,0,0,0,41.697,0,0,289.016,-20.511,0,0,0,-26.697,-2.137,0,0,1366.823,-20.511,269.502,0,-20.511,269.502,109.657,-0.97886,0,0,-0.97886,-239.932,0,20.954,-239.932,109.657,-0.98,38.377,107.52,-0.98,0,1474.343,20.954,0,-0.53458,0,-0.53458,42683,41639,14.153,-49.88,21.3771,14.153,-4.151,23.69028,4.229,(Invalid Formula 0me),4.605,5.12965,16.853,51.265,2.7,18.907,2.39813,-11.20163,3.891,291.932,0,29.57,2.916,NM,-12.70863,289.016,NM,0.46013,279.757,27.77,0.584,399.452,0.56,1.401,0,-4.074,353

Pearson said the stock had climbed after Straight Path announced patent lawsuits against big companies like Apple, Cisco, and Verizon, but that previously won patent cases had not yielded that much in revenue for the company and a recent ruling by the patent office along with a looming 2015 patent expiration date put the company's core patent in doubt. Pearson also said the company's stock had soared over hopes that the FCC might use spectrum assets owned by Straight Path, but that any progress on that front was ""likely to be years away, if ever.""","Summary

Straight Path holds wireless spectrum and patent troll assets. The stock is up by 100% in the past month, and is held overwhelmingly by retail investors.

Announcements that it was suing Apple, Verizon and others sent the stock soaring. But past awards to STRP have been consistently at just $1-$2 million from other giants.

Straight Path's patents begin to expire next year, and two weeks ago (AFTER the Apple/Verizon announcement), elements of the first one were invalidated by the USPTO as ""unpatentable"".

Straight Path's wireless spectrum assets are in the millimeter bands, and are years away from commercialization, if at all. There is currently no logical reason to bid up the stock.

Yet, retail investors have bid up the stock by 100% due to a simple FCC blog post requesting comments on mm spectrum.

Kerrisdale said the company's portfolio would fail to generate value and said that widespread deployment of mmWave frequencies would require extremely expensive networks, which Kerrisdale said was unlikely to ever take place. Kerrisdale added that mmWave was irrelevant for crucial 5G planning, and it said that 5G was likely decades away from peak deployment. Kerrisdale also said that mmWave had fundamental limitations that would sharply restrict its usefulness, as it said that mmWave signals failed to penetrate most building materials. Kerrisdale estimated around 93% downside.","The notion that a company as silly as Straight Path  a 7-person patent troll cum spectrum play,
with the former role having already run its course and the latter premised on an exotic frequency
band that has driven almost everyone who ever touched it into bankruptcy or failure  is worth
almost $600 million defies common sense. Investors have been swept up in 5G hype that is, in
reality, a mixture of marketing fluff and regulatory lobbying, much of which has nothing to do
with mmWave bands at all. In all the excitement, they have overlooked the utter lack of
mmWave spectrum scarcity, the enormous barriers to cost-effective mmWave networks (going
beyond merely weak propagation and extending to issues as fundamental as being able to
access indoor locations from outdoor cell sites), and the entire concept that network operators
are not going to completely overhaul the status quo at enormous cost unless that strategy
presents a compelling return on investment. Looking at prices per MHz-pop as if all frequencies
behaved the same way violates economic logic. To repeat Ericssons basic point, The radio
environment at higher frequencies is simply very different, and with orders-of-magnitude
differences in basic network parameters, like cell density, there will naturally be orders-ofmagnitude
differences in spectrum prices.
At an even more fundamental level, supply and demand govern the price of spectrum as surely
as they govern the price of any commodity. With low demand, given the great difficulties of
practical mmWave deployments, and extremely high supply, given all the spectrum that will be
available in the next several years and beyond, mmWave spectrum will never fetch a high price.
Straight Paths valuation is irrational and unsustainable.

Sinclair Upton said that as a result, Straight Path's licenses were at a high risk of being terminated. Sinclair Upton also said that the company could be banned from future FCC spectrum participation.","Executive Summary
? There is overwhelming evidence that the vast majority of Straight Path Communications'
(""Straight Path"") 39 GHz spectrum licenses' Required Notification of Construction/Coverage
Applications were obtained under fraudulent misrepresentation, because the systems were
never built on the sites as specified in the filings.
? Michael Rapaport, as a representative of IDT Spectrum and Spectrum Holdings Technologies
(""IDT""), the transferors of Straight Path's 39 GHz licenses, has likely committed over 150+
counts of fraud against the US government and made a mockery of the FCC's trust-based
license renewal process. Instead of spending vast amounts of time, money, and resources to
actually building up the required 39 GHz wireless sites in the 173 Basic Economic Areas (BEA)
across the country, IDT/Rapaport gamed the system by filing construction/coverage substantial
service Required Notifications that would pass FCC renewal process with nothing but a word
processor.
? Almost all of the 39 GHz systems that are claimed to be ""constructed"" by IDT to provide
Substantial Service as required for their 39 GHz license renewals in 2011-2012, cannot possibly
been able to meet their performance specifications, as their purported systems defy the laws
of physics, geometry, economics, and common sense. Readers, investors, and the FCC can
easily verify for themselves that IDTs systems were never built or operating at the time of
renewal.
? Even if Straight Path's licenses have any value at all (which they don't), because they were
renewed under false statements of coverage/construction, the licenses are at high risk of being
terminated and stripped from Straight Path's ownership. Thus, the fair value of Straight Path
stock without ownership of the 39 GHz licenses and being banned from future FCC spectrum
participation is $1.00-2.00 per share, or approximately liquidation value.
? We urge the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and regulatory authorities to
immediately open an investigation into the license renewal process of Straight Path's 39 GHz
licenses and ask Straight Path for proof that the Required Constructions were met for all of the
systems claimed to be built in the 173 Basic Economic Areas. Companies should not be allowed
to lie to the US Government and get away with it.

SWHC Full year Guidance was $530-540mm implies roughly $145mm for Q3 and Q4 which we view as impossible given the industry headwinds. Even recent acquisitions won't get SWHC there.

Better managed peer Sturm Ruger reported one month ago: -43% YOY revenue, -77% net income - Cabelas guided that excess inventory won't clear the system for at least a year.

SWHC stuck between rock and hard place: A) Don't discount and sales will drop 40%+ like Ruger or B) Discount heavily to maintain share and crush gross profits.

New acquisition appears to have dubious strategic rationale and now loads the company with nearly $300mm of debt vs estimated normalized EBITDA of ~$60mm: Could lead to chapter 11?

SWHC has a history of spending $100mm+ on acquisitions and writing them off 2 years later in 2007 (Thompson), 2009 (Universal Safety Response), and 2013 (stock buyback at peak).",Competitve Headwinds,debt default risk;growth unustainable;overinvestment by company;too many acquisitions,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation,Nasdaq,fy2014,1,GV_115757,American Outdoor Brands Corporation,IQ414079,Leisure Products,NasdaqGS:AOBC,68.86,626.62,89.305,0,367.515,19.757,68.86,367.515,0,55.89,259.105,8.212,60.542,101.998,0,86.742,5.648,-9.588,239.171,0,-23.744,213.578,0,6.468,120.44,151.459,0,0,-12.112,-1.534,3.425,139.193,0,381.503,-2.471,90.206,37.688,136.722,-62.551,0,48.095,0.101,0,88.627,0,0,0.678,0,92.543,0,-0.243,100,89.305,0,0,0,-62.616,0,-0.471,0,214.68,89.305,101.584,0,88.627,101.584,0.069,1.52221,0,97.739,1.51065,-45.739,-142.283,58.668,-45.739,166.823,1.48128,3.315,166.823,1.47,-117.955,381.503,60.114,0,1.48285,0,1.44718,42537,41759,171.216,0,55.35268,171.216,-59.217,55.18316,-31.627,(Invalid Formula 0me),151.459,3.01382,173.416,163.398,2.2,7.688,2.95194,86.99563,48.778,100,0,55.845,0,35.1772,26.62575,100,0,32.34188,31.14,12.261,27.495,266.823,49.637,108.665,1758,-1.542,520

The Street Sweeper said the company originally had a history of fraud before it went private and then, through a reverse merger, again became public. The Street Sweeper detailed a series of acquisitions the company had made, questioning both the company's financial position and the prudence of the acquisitions. 

At some point after posting its original report, date unclear, The Street Sweeper added, ""For the record, TheStreetSweeper wishes to make clear that it uncovered no evidence showing (or even suggesting) that the current officers and directors of Swisher have engaged in any illegal or improper activities at any time prior to or during the leadership of the company.""","Swisher Hygiene (Nasdaq: SWSH) may have polished its act since going public again, as suggested by the sweeping gains in its stock price, but it nevertheless remains a bleeding sanitation company with a pile of dirt attached to its name.
Shunned like trash before its rescue by Wayne Huizenga and Steven Berrard, longtime business partners credited with building the giant Blockbuster (OTC: BLOBQ.PK) chain during its pre-bankruptcy glory days, Swisher has managed to repackage itself as a future powerhouse  worth more than $1 billion  in the mundane sanitation business. The pair paid less than $20 million for the original Swisher, records indicate, a company sullied at the time by past fraud allegations and a criminal conviction that sent its namesake founder to jail. The duo operated Swisher as a private company for about five years, records show, then took it public again last November through a reverse merger with a Canadian shell caked with some muddy baggage of its own.

They tried to dress Swisher up with acquisitions in the meantime, corporate filings show, but their familiar roll-up strategy failed to deliver consistent revenue gains  let alone actual profits  along the way.

Nevertheless, Swisher saw its market value swell to almost $1.7 billion last month following a breathless rally that had more than doubled its share price since the beginning of the year. While its market value has since fallen to $1.3 billion, following a recent slide in its stock from $11.43 to $8.77 a share, Swisher still commands a rich premium  trading at 19.6 times sales in a sector where the dominant player trades for just two times sales instead -- that looks downright gigantic based on traditional measurement tools. 

Swisher faces the threat of massive dilution, too, which could expand its share count from 148.5 million to almost 260 million (or by 75%) over the course of the next year. The company also carries some less obvious weight, research suggests, with the potential to hammer its stock long before that time.",Incompetent Management,unsavory management;too many acquisitions;recent rally;share selling pressure,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,Swisher Hygiene Inc. ,Nasdaq,fy2011,1,GV_186994,Swisher Hygiene Inc.,IQ326363,Diversified Support Services,-,70.508,160.617,-25.34,0,101.196,11.99,70.508,101.196,-4.359,27.747,59.421,4.648,27.747,79.557,11.126,15.689,0,-13.062,258.289,12.69,-3.421,50.473,0,11.81,35.954,-32.826,0,0,-2.305,0,165.994,-39.475,0,478.404,-1.864,-16.678,17.258,-41.339,-14.904,0,-16.616,0,15.566,-24.723,-121.818,0,-0.623,0,83.604,0,0,47.267,-25.34,0,0,0,-155.05,0.022,-6.107,0,134.548,-25.34,43.557,0,-24.717,43.557,0.175,-1.59313,0,-34.33,-1.55397,-33.809,0,15.90576,-33.809,343.834,-1.59313,194.548,343.856,-1.55397,0,478.404,15.90576,0,-1.55075,0,-1.55075,41715,40908,-20.836,0,17.48101,-20.836,203.304,17.51574,31.576,(Invalid Formula 0me),-32.826,19.669,-14.218,177.84,6.618,2.738,10.17333,-24.66588,0,62.833,0,9.748,15.566,NM,-132.5925,47.267,0,-131.03625,-7.675,0,112.954,406.689,0.1,-35.74,2105,-16.716,151

A new proposed ruling by the IRS looks set to disqualify SunCokes income for MLP purposes.

The Street Sweeper said the company had had to close the plant before for two years starting back in September 2011 when methanol fell to $350 per ton, a price level that methanol had reached again. If the company's ZZ plant were turned off, The Street Sweeper expected the company's stock value to fall back down, adding that the company's business model ""has never been profitable and we doubt it ever will be profitable."" In a response by email to The Street Sweeper, the company said, ""When commodity prices are lower such as they are now, the plants are able to operate in different modes and continue to generate revenues.""","SYMX probably deserves its volatile stock price history, worsened by everything from NASDAQ delisting threats in 2008 and 2010 to the more recent plant shutdowns to insider selling and the unexplained disappearance of an officer and cofounder.

But those issues are merely reactions to a very real, fundamental problem with SYMXs business. That is, the SYMX solution has never been profitable and we doubt it ever will be profitable. The company can be expected to throw more money at the problem, through measures such as more Chinese bank loans and public offerings  if it can find anyone to buy in. That would be doubtful, especially considering the unfortunate experience of the purchasers in the March public offering who are holding $1.80 shares when the share price is currently slightly over a buck.

Meanwhile, some of the lowest methanol prices in years will likely prove to be the painful catalyst that we believe leaves SYMX no way out but to shut down its plant  and its primary means of revenue.",Competitve Headwinds,competitive headwinds;macro issues affecting industry,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,"Synthesis Energy Systems, Inc.",Nasdaq,fy2014,1,GV_160592,"Synthesis Energy Systems, Inc.",IQ20440351,Oil and Gas Equipment and Services,NasdaqCM:SES,19.407,17.507,-14.243,0.05,17.361,2.293,19.457,17.361,0,0.676,0.146,2.219,0.676,9.958,0,0.865,0,-0.672,21.821,2.293,-0.873,46.689,0,0,31.499,-13.649,0,34.856,-0.348,0,2.406,-13.997,0,91.706,0,-9.5,0,-13.997,-0.892,3.251,0,0,0,-13.997,0,0,0,0,10.418,0,0,0,-14.243,-1.547,0,0,-2.439,-0.646,0,3.253,10.418,-14.243,0,0,-14.243,3.253,0.731,-1.72334,0,-165.984,-1.72334,-2.448,0,8.26475,-2.448,81.934,-1.72334,14.664,81.288,-1.72334,0,91.706,8.26475,0,-1.08825,0,-1.08825,42268,41820,-11.356,0,9.13838,-11.358,15.469,9.13838,3.537,(Invalid Formula 0me),-13.649,8.96593,-10.956,79.528,0.4,0.344,8.70264,-8.99413,0,3.251,0,0.805,3.251,0,-5.38975,0,0,-5.15163,-16.206,0,0.241,84.539,0,-12.248,213,0,521

In its first quarter letter to investors, Lakewood argued that sales in the stun guns market was ""mostly driven by replacement demand."" Lakewood said the company's touted opportunities in international markets were ""slow to materialize"" and said the company was unlikely to turn a significant profit in the body camera market, thanks to strong competition and tight margins. Lakewood gave the stock 50% downside.","Taser International is widely known for its weapons segment, which produces stun guns that represent close to 90% of total sales. While the weapons business is effectively a monopoly, it has already reached nearly full penetration, and sales are now mostly driven by replacement demand. Last year this business had record volume with 98,000 professional units sold.

Taser Internationals sales

We believe a fair portion of these sales reflects catch-up replacement demand from strained police budgets coming out of the recession. On average, Taser sold 72,000 units annually over the prior nine years. We believe the useful life of a Taser stun gun is seven to ten years, and given Taser Internationals installed base of approximately 600,000 units, normalized demand is well below 100,000 units. Additionally, we believe current operating margins of 35% may be at peak levels versus a 17% average over the past five years. Taser has also touted opportunities in international markets, but our research indicates that this has been slow to materialize (despite a decade of Tasers efforts) due to cultural differences as many international police forces do not carry weapons at all. At a generous 20x earnings, the weapons business would be worth $12 per share compared to Tasers current price of approximately $30 per share.",Competitve Headwinds,strategy issues;macro issues affecting industry,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,"TASER International, Inc.",Nasdaq,fy2015,1,GV_143912,"Axon Enterprise, Inc.",IQ885779,Aerospace and Defense,NasdaqGS:AAXN,59.526,197.892,19.933,50.254,69.245,3.291,109.78,69.245,0,27.701,128.647,7.263,27.701,69.698,0,15.763,23.614,3.017,161.409,0,3.14,57.868,0,5.868,21.848,35.335,15.527,8.525,0.226,0,17.184,35.361,0,229.881,0,46.445,7.333,35.361,-6.003,0,15.428,0.04,0,19.933,-11.186,0,0,0,38.14,0,-0.501,0.081,19.933,-18.359,0,0,-36.009,0,0,0,72.877,19.933,0,0,19.933,0,0.001,0.37225,0,100.978,0.37225,-0.08,-122.201,53.548,-0.08,157.004,0.36,2.673,157.004,0.36,-8.926,229.881,54.638,0,0.41273,0,0.40449,43160,42369,38.626,0,53.69219,38.626,0.603,53.69407,11.159,(Invalid Formula 0me),35.335,2.92415,39.626,139.82,1,0,2.6041,22.10063,6.759,0.081,0,-0.08,0,43.6299,34.17913,0.081,0,34.22538,-109.699,0,-8.077,157.085,14.59,32.623,549,0.994,720

Glaucus sent 13 Teavana samples to an accredited lab in Germany and found that 100% of samples contained pesticides. Since being pesticide free was a major component of Teavana's appeal and price, Glaucus predicted this would very negatively affect the company's brand. Further, Starbucks had recently agreed to pay $620 million for the company, and Glaucus said this amounted to a failure to disclose material information and would breach the merger agreement between the two companies.

The same day, Teavana responded to the report, saying it ""refutes the report's conclusions."" It said that all its teas ""undergo rigorous third-party testing"" and that the company had ""established internal procedures...to ensure all tea is safe and within"" international food safety standards.","Selling the Healthy Lifestyle. Teavanas brand is built on the perception that Teavanas teas
are healthier than other teas because they are pesticide free. The Company states in its SEC
filings that it rigorously tests every batch of tea under EU pesticide standards. 98% of the
salespeople at the 80 retail stores we called stated unequivocally that the Companys teas are
pesticide free. Watch our video (available here) for recordings of some of the phone calls.
2. Independent Lab Tests Indicate Consumer Fraud. As consumers of Teavanas premium
priced teas, we wanted to make sure we were drinking teas that are as healthy as the Company
claims. So we sent thirteen of Teavanas most popular teas to an accredited lab in
Germany for testing. The lab is the world leader in food, pharmacological and environmental
laboratory testing. Lab tests showed the following:
a. Pesticides Abound. 100% of the tea samples contained pesticides, many of which are
classified by the EPA as Possible Human Carcinogens. One of Teavanas most popular
and expensive teas, Monkey Picked Oolong, was the most contaminated with 23
pesticides.
b. Teas Violate US Law. 100% of the tea samples violate U.S. food pesticide standards
(CFR Title 40 sect 180), meaning they are adulterated under the FDCA and subject to
federal seizure. We believe Teavana will recall its adulterated teas rather than risk the
civil and criminal liability it may incur by knowingly selling adulterated products over

Pearson said its product was effective, but because the dry eye test often was not covered by insurance plans and was not substantially more effective than a verbal assessment of dry eye symptoms, the company did not have significant room to grow. He also noted that TearLab had never once made a profit and has made an equity offering in ever single one of the last ten years, diluting the share price and hurting investors. He predicted another equity offering in the next few weeks.","Conclusion

The low price point and limited market need for tear osmolarity tests means that the only way for TearLab to continue generating sales is to continue with a heavy marketing spend. This need almost entirely precludes TearLab from generating a profit in coming years. The company has already disclosed that it will continue to incur heavy losses again in 2013 and even bullish brokerages predict continuing losses for years to come.

Recent NIH estimates indicate that there are only around 6 million applicable patients in the U.S.

If TearLab tests were used on 100% of all patients in the US then total revenues would be just $120 million. TearLab's current market cap is double the entire market size.

The stock has nearly doubled in 2013 due to analyst upgrades from brokerages who are eager for investment banking roles.

The catalyst for a decline in the stock will be its next equity offering which will likely need to occur at a price of around $6.00 or below due to the poor liquidity of the stock.

Once the offering is out of the way and the analyst upgrades fade, it is unclear what will support this stock at $6.00 given that there is no prospect for profitability over the next few years.",Strategy,strategy issues;product not as valuable as perceived;competitive headwinds;inappropriate valuation methods,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,TearLab Corp.,Nasdaq,fy2013,1,GV_161071,TearLab Corporation,IQ11248163,Health Care Supplies,OTCPK:TEAR,37.778,14.645,-28.99,0,7.607,1.867,37.778,7.607,0,3.524,7.038,3.738,3.524,21.773,0,0.885,1.095,-2.635,42.886,0.539,0.978,4.695,1.215,-0.436,3.429,-17.584,0,0,0.035,0,3.602,-28.8,0,49.957,-0.19,-13.234,0.631,-28.99,-2.905,0,0,0,0,-28.99,0,0,0,0,8.589,0,0,0,-28.99,0,0,0,-2.905,0,0,0,8.589,-28.99,0,0,-28.99,0,0.033,-9.42479,0,-435.837,-9.42479,0,0,3.07593,0,41.368,-9.42479,41.516,41.368,-9.42479,0,49.957,3.07593,0,-5.85189,0,-5.85189,42438,41639,-15.717,0,3.32887,-15.717,38.48,3.35737,22.341,(Invalid Formula 0me),-17.584,12.42704,-15.494,37.766,0.223,0,11.34499,-18,0,0,0,0,0,0,-10.905,0,0,-10.905,-37.778,0,2.615,41.368,0,-18.622,101,0,356

Glaucus Research said the company's Ebola drug, TKM Ebola, was unsafe and unlikely to be approved by the FDA, with physicians preferring other experimental Ebola drugs over Tekmira's drug. Glaucus Research said that dwindling licensing and partnering deals with Tekmira showed that ""developers and other insiders do not assign Tekmira's technology a high probability of commercial success."" Glaucus Research also said the intravenous administration required for Tekmira's Ebola drug would prevent it from being widely adopted in Sub-Saharan Africa, where medical professionals and equipment were lacking. Given Tekmira's sharp rise over Ebola concerns, Glaucus Research predicted the company's stock would fall back to $7-10 per share.","1. Dose of Reality. In July 2014, the FDA placed a clinical hold on Phase I trials of TKM Ebola, reportedly because of
elevated cytokine levels among healthy volunteers (which at higher levels can prompt dangerous inflammation and
other negative responses from the immune system). A failure at this stage over safety concerns makes it highly unlikely
the drug will ever be approved.
a. Doctors Fear that TKM Ebola is Toxic and Unsafe. Temporary approval for emergency administration does
not change the fact that the FDA halted Phase I trials because of TKM Ebolas safety risks and potential toxicity.
Indeed, experts have cautioned that treating physicians may be reluctant to administer TKM Ebola because of the
perceived risk: they may want to use a drug with the cleanest safety profile. You may not want to give him a
drug that will push [patients] over the edge. Put simply, TKM Ebola has not been shown to be either safe or
effective and its limited use in the current crisis does not increase the likelihood of approval by the FDA.
b. Treating Physicians Seem to Prefer Other Experimental Treatments. To our knowledge, TKM Ebola was
only administered after supplies of a competitive treatment, ZMapp, were exhausted. TKM Ebola has only been
administered to two patients (one in Nebraska, one in Norway) and the hospital in the US which first administered
TKM Ebola chose a competitors drug, Brincidofovir, to treat a subsequent patient. It appears that treating
physicians clearly favor blood transfusions from survivors, Brincidofovir and especially ZMapp over TKM Ebola.
2. Partners Know Best: Declining Interest in Licensing or Partnering with Tekmira. Pharmaceutical companies who
have signed licensing, collaboration or partnership deals with Tekmira appear unlikely to renew such arrangements and
seem uninterested in pursuing further commercial relationships. Specifically, Roche, Alnylam and Bristol Myers
Squibb all signed deals with Tekmira at the height of RNAi excitement in 2008-2009, and subsequently each one either
terminated this collaboration (Roche, Alnylam) or seem uninterested in increasing a paltry commercial commitment
(BSM). It therefore appears that developers and other insiders do not assign Tekmiras technology a high probability
of commercial success.

Saying its report should be read in conjunction with The Street Sweeper, Copperfield said the company ""categorically falsified"" the effects of a recent acquisition and that these and other accounting maneuvers meant the organic growth rate was well below 20%, possibly close to zero for the year-to-date. Copperfield also took issue with several sellside arguments about how to properly view the company's financials, saying shaky deferred revenue growth and one-time recurring benefits to cash flows from acquisitions demonstrated a company with a weak financial position.
","1) Tangoe is a fast growth SaaS business - FALSE

We believe that Tangoe's financial profile and key business metrics are not consistent with those of SaaS peers. Non-recurring consulting services, the resale of telecommunication accessories, a deferred revenue balance showing minimal growth, BPO-like gross margins that are roughly 2000 basis points below the purported SaaS comps, and revenue per employee that is 50% lower than its ""comps"" all suggest Tangoe is little more than a body shop.

2) Tangoe's organic growth rate is 20% - 25%- FALSE

Based on our analysis Tangoe has been systematically underreporting the revenue contribution from acquisitions, which has had the effect of misrepresenting the company's organic growth. Our analysis suggests the CFO categorically falsified the impact from a recent acquisition on the Q2'12 earnings call, understating its impact by up to 60% compared to the figures disclosed in their quarterly 10Q. This would mark the second time in the last three quarters that Tangoe has provided a lower revenue contribution from acquisitions on its calls than it ultimately discloses in SEC filings. This effectively overstates organic growth.

3) Deferred Revenue Growth is not a Reliable Business Metric - FALSE

Tangoe has repeatedly claimed that changes in deferred revenues are not indicative of its organic growth rate, which would be problematic because deferred revenues have actually contracted over the last three quarters. Inconsistencies between Tangoe's disclosed revenue recognition policy for implementation fees (ratably over twice the term of the customer contract) and a declining balance of deferred implantation fees would seem to suggest Tangoe may not be growing organic new customers. Implementation fees, which should grow as the company adds new customers, have grown 0% since December 2010, the first date it reported this metric.

4) The REAL Organic Growth Rate

We are unable to reconcile CFO Martino's public statements about organic growth. Current SEC filings combined with management's guidance at face value, leads to an implied organic revenue growth rate that IS WELL BELOW 20%. Based on our analysis, we believe Tangoe's organic growth rate may be almost 50% lower year-to-date than the rate many analysts have communicated. If we assume ProfitLine's revenue is flat year-over-year (rather than the decline management implied with their guidance) and we annualize the revenue for ttMobiles from Q1'12, then organic growth has been closer to ZERO year-to-date.

5) Based on 20%-25% organic growth - here would be the conservative estimates for Q3 and Q4",Other information,unsavory management;accounting misrepresentation;organic growth overstated,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Tangoe, Inc.",Nasdaq,fy2012,1,GV_184715,"Tangoe, Inc.",IQ2862715,Software,-,50.211,154.512,3.038,0,70.603,8.741,50.211,70.603,0,38.309,83.909,9.165,38.309,54.157,0,0,16.696,-5.883,91.904,8.666,0,12.216,0,1.31,3.999,4.39,-1.864,0,-0.863,0,110.074,3.518,0,207.268,0,16.688,9.128,3.518,-1.82,0,0.48,0,22.443,3.038,-38.41,0,0,0,53.559,0,0,0.131,3.038,0,0,0,-40.23,0,0,0,58.648,3.038,0.778,0,3.038,0.778,0.004,0.08325,0,-53.757,0.08325,-9.676,0,36.492,-9.676,148.62,0.08,41.996,148.62,0.08,-2.7,207.268,39.87,0,0.06025,0,0.05515,42079,41274,13.131,0,37.61333,13.131,30.398,37.7438,6.804,(Invalid Formula 0me),4.39,3.95126,18.15,38.546,5.019,0.127,1.0248,2.19875,0.284,22.574,0,-8.898,22.443,13.6441,12.48238,0.131,0,12.27075,-27.637,0.943,6.559,171.194,0.297,11.311,1383,0.183,246

On 8-23-2013, Citron published a report to its website, calling Tesla a ""story"" stock, and it noted that CEO Elon Musk said, ""I think the valuation we have right now is more than we have any right to deserve.""

On 9-25-2013, Citron said that the stock was ""perched at a level of extreme unsustainability,"" and it said the stock was a bubble. Citron said the stock was priced as if nothing could go wrong, but it believed many problems could occur, including a need to raise capital for CapEx, competition from luxury brands, inability to mass-produce cars in California, cannibalization of Model S buyers by the Model X or pre-owned Model S's, failure to penetrate China, failure to establish dealer networks in pushback states and R&D expense requirements to create new compelling product (automated cars). On 3-1-2016, Citron tweeted that it was shorting Tesla. Citron said that supply and demand problems should take Tesla's share price to $100 by the end of the year, and it added that the news flow did ""not look good"" for the stock. Shares traded down about 4.8% on the news. On 3-2-2016, in an interview with CNBC, Citron's Andrew Left said that as the price of oil had started to increase, commentators had drawn a link between Tesla shares and oil, but Left said that the correlation was wrong. Left also said that sell-side research pointed to a much lower supply and that difficulties in producing Tesla's Model X were not a surprise. Left noted that the news flow surrounding Tesla indicated that the company had outdated technology, and he added that the news flow for the Model X was more balanced as compared to the ""fanaticism"" of the Model S.","Fundamentally, not much has changed in 3 months and the stock is 60% higher.  Citron believes that not even in Mr. Musks most wildly optimistic moment did he think his stock would have such a stratospheric run. The reality is that once Tesla fills the orders from the early adopters, movie stars and high net worth trend setters, and begins to depend on the everyday mass market, buying a car is the most price-sensitive purchase in the marketplace.  The average customer walks through the dealers door knowing full well, as does the dealer, exactly how many dollars per month they will fork over to close the deal.  It is not a question of emerging technology. The need to raise capital for CAPEX expenses
The inability to manufacture and sell profitably without environmental credits
(which they have not been able to do yet)
Competition on the high-end from the worlds foremost prestige brands
The inability to mass-produce cars affordably in California (Doing business in
California has become cost prohibitive, that is why Tesla has the only large scale
factory in the state)
Cannibalization of Model S buyers by the Model X
Cannibalization of Model S buyers to pre-owned Model S within 2 years
Failure to penetrate China due to lack of infrastructure to support pure electric

The Journal reported that Chanos said Tesla had gone beyond an interesting product or innovation to become speculative and a cult stock. On 5-7-2015, Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates made several cautionary comments on Tesla. Chanos said the company's newly unveiled storage batteries were uneconomic in the US and criticized the company's cash burn rate. Chanos did not specifically state that Kynikos had a short position. Chanos had previously made bearish comments about the company but had declined from disclosing if he was short the stock.On 10-8-2015, Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates said in an interview with CNN that it would be difficult for Tesla to navigate from being a small, boutique elite car manufacturer to becoming a mass market auto manufacturer that would compete with the likes of BMW and GM. Chanos also said that the company's stock was valued as if Tesla would successfully sell millions of cars, which he said would require greater capital investment. Chanos had discussed Tesla in less detail several times in the past two years, including at the Heard on the Street conference on 10-7-2013 and in an interview with CNBC on 9-9-2015, but did not disclose that he held a short position.

On 10-12-2015, in an interview with Bloomberg, Chanos said that BMW sold about 2,000 electric cars in the U.S. during the month of September, which Chanos said was about as many as Tesla had sold. Chanos added that Tesla had a head start in the market but that other companies were catching up, and he added that much of Tesla's technology belonged to others. Chanos also reiterated that becoming a car manufacturer would be more difficult for Tesla than becoming a high-tech company, as Chanos said car manufacturing was capital intensive and required huge networks. Chanos said that he had not officially disclosed a position but that he was a ""potential purchaser"" and was not positive on the company.","The guts of this product [the battery] is made by Panasonic,"" he argued on ""Squawk Box"" Friday.

Pearson explained that because phase II trials effectiveness were ""barely significant at the 5% level,"" launching of phase III had been repeatedly delayed, and very similar, generic versions could come to market before Rolapitant, shareholders should anticipate a ""volatile ride"" in the coming weeks. He offered Tesaro's attempts to seek opportunities outside of Rolapitant as further proof of the drug's riskiness.
","In evaluating these developments, one must remember that Tesaro is entirely dependent upon Rolapitant for any revenue potential within the next 4 years. One must also remember that the phase II results for Rolapitant were in fact quite marginal.

Phase III trials for Rolapitant are now being repeatedly delayed as enrollment continues well beyond the deadline.

First, this does not bode well for the overall results of Rolapitant in phase III.

Second, even the mere delay of phase III results is highly problematic for Tesaro. This is because the delay will negatively impact Tesaro's ability to actually sell the drug due to Emend going off patent as well as the coming launch of Netupitant.

As a result of these factors, Tesaro is clearly trying to position itself as a company which has other alternatives and opportunities beyond Rolapitant. The company is raising money without a defined use of proceeds and is de-emphasizing Rolapitant in its conference calls. In short, Tesaro is well aware of the impending problem, even though investors are not.

It remains the case that at least 80% of the value of the share price is a function of the prospects for Rolapitant. Even optimists do not predict Niraparib revenues until 2017.

As a result, when Helsinn releases results for Netupitant in the next few weeks, Tesaro shareholders should expect a volatile ride with the share price potentially heading back to below $21.00, where it began the month of April.

Investors also need to keep in mind that over 18 million insider shares of Tesaro were locked up due to the recent equity offering. This lockup expired on April 28th, just in time for the shares to hit all-time highs. Yet this is also just in time for selling to be possible just as Netupitant results are coming to market.",Product ineffective,clinical trials unsuccessful;share selling presure;competitive headwinds;product not as valuable as perceived,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,"Tesaro, Inc.",Nasdaq,fy2013,1,GV_170969,"Tesaro, Inc.",IQ106485352,Biotechnology,-,130.31,0,-92.362,0,0,0.179,130.31,0,1.94,0,0,7.759,0,14.78,0,0,75.725,0,134.339,0,0,0.715,0,-1.301,0.44,-90.505,0,0,0.083,0,0,-90.422,0,135.578,-1.94,-84.888,1.869,-92.362,-0.4,0,0,0,0,-92.362,0,0,0,0,12.423,0,-1.94,0,-92.362,0,0,0,-2.34,0,0,0,12.426,-92.362,0,0,-92.362,0,0.003,-2.92665,0,-179.498,-2.92665,0,0,31.559,0,123.152,-2.92665,92.093,123.152,-2.92665,0,135.578,31.559,0,-1.79073,0,-1.79073,42429,41639,-90.326,0,32.6366,-90.326,92.093,32.6366,4.865,(Invalid Formula 0me),-90.505,3.77343,-89.679,123.152,0.647,0,3.77343,-56.51375,0,0,0,0,0,0,-53.11663,0,0,-53.11663,-130.31,0,2.149,123.152,0,-90.726,62,0,362

A failure to generate a penny of cumulative cash flow, despite claims of spectacular revenue and earnings growth.
A revenue recognition and accounts receivable policy that does not appear to conform to GAAP accounting. 
A blatant admission in their public filings that they recognize revenue and services before goods and services are rendered - while failing to disclose any unbilled receivables.
An apparent change in the ratio of allowance for doubtful accounts that overstated earnings last quarter by roughly $0.22 per share.  The overstatement occurred directly in front of an $18.9 million capital raise.
Two separate auditor resignations, a mere seven months apart from each other.
A claim to have developed a meaningful ""new industry standard"" in wireless despite spending less than $1 million per year in research and development.
A much smaller public competitor that has a notably different balance sheet, A/R policy, and cash flow profile.
Their glorified and seminal entry into the U.S. market is with a distributor that was incorporated fifteen months AFTER Telestone claims to have started the relationship.
Three different CFO's in the last three years, as well as a history of IR and corporate contacts that appear and vanish with a convoluted trail that would leave the great Sherlock Holmes stumped.

Generally, its flying under the radar.

Market blindness toward TTGTs issues - combined with the release of a positive earnings report the same day a public offering was kicked off - created an atmosphere that allowed the smooth sale of millions of TTGT shares.

TTGT director Jay Hoag and others indirectly sold 2.8 million shares for $17 million, as part of the May public offering of 5 million shares  offered at a slight discount by Polaris Venture entities and by entities of Technology Crossover Venture, managed by Mr. Hoag. Selling shareholders, not TTGT, received the proceeds.

Those shareholders joined other insiders who may have been tipping their hand as theyve sold multi-millions worth of TTGT in just the last six months. In fact, insiders have sold and sold over the years, pocketing upwards of $63 million.

Indeed, TTGT is largely ignored by analysts, sports a ridiculously generous $6 price target and reports yearly revenue declines that have deepened since 2011. The operating income of this company with the stunning $265 million market cap has consistently dropped to the point of losing $2.5 million in 2013.

Now, TTGT must try to overcome that seemingly gentle, doe-eyed virtual monster that has chomped away at both search traffic and SEO visibility so vital to its business of delivering customers.

It said Beijing Pingxiu, which had almost no profit and operated out of an unknown location, was wholly owned by Fumitake Nishi, a Tile Shop employee and the CEO's brother-in-law, and that this relationship was undisclosed. Gotham said the company was ""improperly overstating inventories"" to boost gross profits.

Spruce Point said the company's move to join the AMEX market earlier in the year was not the result of improved fundamentals at the company but an opportunity to ""dilute public shareholders"" and allow long-time shareholders the option to ""liquidate longtime holdings."" Spruce Point said the company's move to expand into antimony mining (rather than just processing) in Mexico was not based on any SEC-compliant proven reserves, and so investors should be wary of the success of that endeavor. Additionally, Spruce Point said antimony faced becoming obsolete with plenty of substitutes available and a decline in lead-acid batteries, antimony's second largest end market. Spruce Point further noted that the company had never earned a profit beyond a penny a share in the last decade.","There are limited organic demand drivers to push prices higher, as global consumption of this commodity is tied to GDP growth, with no known new application drivers to spur added demand. Antimony's biggest end market is flame retardant products, and its second key end-market is lead acid batteries, which is in secular decline. Multiple substitutes of this commodity also exist, which will also suppress further price increases.

Investors for Truth noted that new capital was used to fund distributions to existing investors, and it said that subsequent UDF companies provided significant liquidity to earlier UDF companies. Investors for Truth also said that if the funding mechanism funneling retail capital to the latest UDF company were to be halted, earlier UDF companies would not be capable of standing alone and that the entire structure would likely unravel. It also questioned 19 red flags regarding UDF's loans, which Investors for Truth said were materially overstated, and it also said that the loans either had insufficient reserves or inadequate collateral supporting them. Investors for Truth additionally noted that the company's independent registered accounting firm, Whitley Penn, had declined to stand for reappointment, which Investors for Truth said raised questions about the legitimacy of the UDF structure, the financial condition of the companies and Whitley Penn's prior audit work.On 12-11-2015, Investors for Truth said that UDF's statement did not refute any allegations, and it discussed how it believed capital from later UDF vintages and new investors was used to provide liquidity to older UDF vintages and older investors. Investors for Truth also said that UDF V specifically stated that it would not lend to affiliates or participate in loans issued by affiliates, but Investors for Truth said that UDF V had indirectly and effectively lent to an affiliated program by issuing half of its loans to date to Centurion, which Investors for Truth said was UDF III and UDF IV's largest borrower, and specifically to entities that had loans outstanding due to UDF III and UDF IV at the time of issuance.Later that day, Investors for Truth said that a lawsuit related to UDF III and UDF IV's second largest ""non-affiliated"" borrower, Buffington Land, accounted for approximately 11% of UDF IV's outstanding loan balance and 25% of UDF's outstanding balance, but Investors for Truth said that the lawsuit alleged that Buffington had failed to repay an earlier loan from BHM Highpointe. Investors for Truth also said BHM Highpointe owed loans to UDF IV but was insolvent or rendered insolvent by the transfer to Buffington Land.

Investors for Truth also said that UDF III had filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition claim for $106.5 million against an affiliate and entity that Buffington controlled. Investors for Truth said that the claim represented approximately 25% of UDF III's total assets, and it said that UDF III had not sufficiently reserved against the Buffington loans. Investors for Truth also said that if Buffington was insolvent and UDF III lacked the liquidity to cure a third-party senior lender's loan in default, UDF III's collateral would enter bankruptcy or foreclosure, and Investors for Truth added that UDF III's management was misleading investors as to why it had failed to pay its debts in a timely manner.

On 12-15-2015, Investors for Truth issued a response to UDF's earlier 8-K filing, and it said that management's responses were ""deceptive."" Investors for Truth also said that UDF materially omitted ""Deficiency Notes"" in its response, and it said that historical losses by the insiders' private entities totaled $153 million. Investors for Truth also noted a discrepancy between a 1.75% interest rate for Deficiency Notes owed by insiders versus a 14% interest rate for Deficiency Notes owed by ""non-related parties,"" and it questioned why public shareholders of UDF-managed entities paid a ""trust administration fee"" to management as compensation to manage historical losses. It additionally said that management never disclosed that the largest borrower for UDF III, UDF IV and UDF V was also the largest borrower of all three companies.","We broke the story today because two posts  one on VIC and the other on HVST (by an anonymous individual possibly connected with Hayman) allege the company to be a fraud. Management fees are assessed on the value of assets under management. If the book value of the Companies assets is materially overstated, the external manager may have improperly received inflated management fees.United Development Funding III, UDF IV and UMT are not reserving against certain loans that have a high probability of being impaired (e.g. loans that remain outstanding but that have not matured). On November 30, 2015, UDF V released a Form 8-K disclosing that William Kahane, a director of United Development Funding  Vs Board of Directors, had resigned. Kahanes resignation was effective as of November 24, 2015, which was the same day that United Development Funding V and the other Companies each released a Forms 8-K disclosing that Whitley Penn would no longer be the Companies auditor.Insiders have made loans to themselves through affiliates of UMT at interest rates below the 10-Yr US treasury rate in the form of unsecured deficiency notes and recourse obligations totaling $73 million as of the quarter ended September 30, 2015.

Kerrisdale said that syringes were a ""low-cost, commoditized item,"" and that the company could not reasonably compete with other multi-billion dollar companies in the market who could ""always out-compete [Unilife] on price and design quality."" With a history of poor management, inability to deliver and overpricing in the market because of two recent contract announcements with Novartis and Hikma, Kerrisdale predicted a 75% fall in the company's stock. On 12-19-2013, Kerrisdale released a follow-up report, saying that underwriters were climbing over each other to talk up the company's stock in anticipation of another equity offering. Kerrisdale said the company was running out of cash and would likely need to raise money before the end of the year. Rather than the stock's rise being due to expected growth, Kerrisdale instead said that the long thesis was ""premised on the success of the stock promotion.""On 2-4-2014, Kerrisdale reiterated its criticisms and said nothing had changed at Unilife in the intervening months since its last report. Kerrisdale said the company was continuing to experience a cash crunch, had offered a dilutive secondary as predicted and was still unable to demonstrate how it was going to attain meaningful revenues and justify its $440 million market capitalization.
On 3-21-2014, Kerrisdale released a fourth report, noting that the company's CFO had suddenly resigned most likely because he wanted ""to monetize his shares while they still [had] value,"" and Kerrisdale criticized the company's recent debt financing as likely to accelerate Unilife's demise. Kerrisdale said the terms of the recent $60 million financing were ""usurious."" It also disclosed it was long RVP.

","But this disconnect hasn't prevented Unilife from leaning on an ever-morphing roster of shareholders to fund its aggressive cash burn rate.Unilife's preferred method of raising equity is to announce a series of potential production deals just ahead of selling stock. This rhythmic sequence first began in 2002 after Unilife's Australia-listed shares climbed to the equivalent of $13 after Shortall promised that Unilife would be producing 65m retractable needles by March 2004. Now, just two months away from 2014, even eternally optimistic sell-side analysts can't bring themselves to model $400m revenue targets in 2015 or 2016.",Overvalued by markets,Recent rally;Cash shortage;Additional Equity offerings to fund company;Growth overstated;Ineffective management/staff;lackluster product;Competitive headwinds;Stock promotion;Management turnover;Managerial self-dealing;Debt default risk;Cash shortage;lackluster sales,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,Unilife Corporation,Nasdaq,fy2013,1,GV_254399,Unilife Corporation,IQ6284819,Health Care Supplies,-,5.736,2.743,-63.198,0,0.128,5.435,5.736,0.128,0,0.654,2.615,13.287,0.654,32.437,0,0.071,21.749,0.388,9.27,9.487,0.141,59.112,0,0.065,46.106,-61.058,0.725,0,-2.392,0,11.521,-63.198,0,68.401,0,-41.333,3.428,-63.198,-2.24,0,0,0,3.826,-63.198,0,0,0,0,12.708,0,0,20.045,-63.198,0,0,0,-2.24,0,0,0,32.803,-63.198,0,0,-63.198,0,0.956,-7.78629,0,-235.832,-7.78629,-5.024,-0.14,8.11658,-5.024,35.598,-7.79,42.933,35.598,-7.79,0,68.401,8.11658,0,-4.86643,0,-4.86643,42667,41455,-55.623,0,9.23195,-55.623,37.909,9.23195,-5.674,(Invalid Formula 0me),-61.058,3.85596,-55.323,24.077,0.3,2.479,2.60801,-39.49875,0,23.871,0,-5.024,3.826,0,-20.69925,20.045,0,-19.20425,18.135,2.392,-2.475,59.469,0,-57.863,159,0,367

Pearson detailed promotional activities by several entities that trumpeted huge gains in a stock as soon as a press release was out mentioning work with a billion dollar company. Once the full picture was taken into consideration, Pearson said investors realized the significant risks involved and that story held true for Unilife and its recent Novartis announcement. Additionally, Pearson stressed that the syringe market had several large and well-financed companies and that there was no compelling explanation for why the company would suddenly have millions in revenue when other companies had such robust alternatives. Pearson also predicted an imminent equity offering, saying the company was nearly out of cash. On 3-27-2014, Pearson released a longer piece detailing promotional activities at several companies. One of companies mentioned was Unilife. Pearson detailed how certain Seeking Alpha authors were paid by and directly encouraged by Unilife's CEO to boast about the company. As part of his research, Pearson said he submitted detailed complaints to the SEC.","As with Unilife, the shorts made their case by citing a horrible track record by management, including huge share sales despite no revenues.

Citron criticized a lack of detail on two other recent deals, including the December 7th press release. It also said the company was misleading investors by claiming it could get 50% margins while having spent almost nothing on research and development since 2008 compared to its competitors. Citron criticized stock promoters pumping the stock up and assurances from the company in recent weeks it would not have a secondary offering. Also on 4-23-2013, Citron Research released a follow-up report, saying it believed ""that Unipixel shareholders are being intentionally duped."" It demanded that the company release details on a recent agreement made with Kodak and explain how it had not sold half its primary product for almost nothing. Citron also invited SEC scrutiny on the company and a lawsuit from Uni-Pixel if it believed Citron's assessment was inaccurate.

Citron had associates go undercover and register as salespeople with USANA. According to presented documentation, the company had new salespeople come to Hong Kong to sign up for a bank account in order to skirt China's pyramid regulation laws. Citron also included evidence of the Chinese government cracking down on USANA operations in the country, citing them as illegal. At a minimum, Citron said the company was failing to properly disclose material risks to investors or the SEC. Previously, Citron had noted the company's purchase of a small company at a premium for its direct selling licenses. At the time, Citron emphasized that these did not make multi-level marketing any more legal in Mainland China.On 7-23-2013, Citron issued a follow-up report, going into more detail and providing further evidence for USANA's multi-level marketing campaign in Mainland China. Citron questioned the company's lumping all sales in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and China into a single reporting group given that the largest set of its sales associates are in that country group and that region saw the most growth. Citron obtained information of thousands of sales associates in China and found hundreds of them registered under the same address, which was often a vacated apartment. Citron further suggested that the company was likely skirting tax and trade laws by selling its products without the proper approvals, and that the company was focused on hiring more sales associates to further a pyramid scheme, rather than sell its product.

On 7-15-2014, Citron issued a new report, saying ""multiple media outlets in China have exposed the MLM schemes operated by USANA...in China."" Citron said that, similar to the Chinese media scrutiny and subsequent large drop at NuSkin, USANA could also be facing a sudden drop in its stock.","First, note the date: Sept 29, 2012. TV news report on a recent encounter with a salesman visiting Mr. Shen's
family, promoting Usana's nutritional products. The packaged product does not carry serialized licensing
number, is not registered with the Chinese equivalent of the FDA, and is not labeled and does not provide instructions in Chinese; all of which are conditions which render such product sales illegal in China. Investigation reveals Usana managers actively participating in creating illegal pyramid compensation scheme to circumvent China's anti-MLM laws. Prospective Usana reps from mainland China travel to Hong Kong, where they are instructed by Usana reps on

Suhail said that Veeva's market cap already exceeded its reported total addressable market opportunity and added that the market was actually no greater than $840 million. Suhail noted that Veeva had only achieved single digit CRM market penetration, and Suhail noted that Veeva's relationship with Salesforce.com came with inherent growth limitations that were not discounted by the stock price. Suhail set a price target of $8 and estimated 65-80% downside.

On 12-4-2013, Suhail questioned particular research within Veeva's underwriters' initial reports, calling many statements ""misleading, factually inaccurate, and utterly illogical."" Suhail also said that Veeva's initiations should all be suspended.

On 12-5-2013, Suhail said that five of Veeva's underwriters had used the wrong revenues in their initiation reports. Suhail said the underwriters had not issued corrections for the models but had instead changed the share count and assumptions to maintain the targets.

On 12-10-2013, Suhail said that Veeva's six underwriters had not revised their initiation reports, and Suhail said that Deutsche Bank and Canaccord's analysts had actually raised their price targets. Suhail also noted that Veeva's management said that the company had about 450,000 global pharmaceutical sales representatives, but Suhail said Veeva had disclosed a count of 400,000 to one of its underwriters.

On 12-11-2013, Suhail commented on Accelrys' acquisition of Qumas, which Suhail said was a comparable for Veeva's Vault. Suhail noted that Qumas' deal terms were two and a half times its 2012 revenues, but Suhail said that Veeva's current valuation represented 1000-2000 times Veeva's 2012 revenues. Suhail added that the life sciences ECM space was not a segment suited for high growth or high multiples.

On 12-19-2013, Suhail criticized an underwriter's analysis of Veeva's CRM total addressable market, which Suhail said the underwriter had calculated as $2.4 billion. Suhail said using a more reliable customer range would produce a CRM life sciences total addressable market of $48-240 million. Suhail also noted that Veeva's S-1 cited a 2016 estimated market size figure as the 2012 actual size. 

On 1-15-2014, Suhail said that it had discovered that Veeva had lost Genentech's CRM customer contract to Salesforce.com's PAAS solution, which Suhail said was surprising because Genentech was Veeva's first big name customer and was cited as a customer in the press coverage of Veeva's IPO. Suhail said this implied that Veeva's average selling price per life sciences CRM seat would decrease and that Veeva did not have any bargaining power with Salesforce.com. Suhail added that Salesforce.com's PAAS offering was the biggest threat to Veeva's CRM business.

Later that day, Suhail said that Pacific Crest's skepticism that Veeva lost a client to Salesforce.com was ""comical,"" and Suhail said that it was 100% certain Veeva had experienced the loss to Salesforce.com. On 1-16-2014, Suhail commented on Veeva's acknowledgement of the Genentech contract loss and questioned why the company had not filed an 8-K in response to press releases that had highlighted Genentech as a customer. Suhail added that the company had overstated the size of its ""addressable customer"" segment by at least 300%. Suhail also said that sell-side initiation reports had not mentioned competitive threats such as IMS One or the existence of other life sciences CRM ISV's on the Salesforce.com platform.

On 3-4-2014, Suhail posted a list of questions for Veeva's management to Seeking Alpha. Suhail asked if Veeva planned to disclose its average realized selling price going forward, how Suhail should model the impact of average selling price evolution in emerging markets versus developed markets, how the company calculated its CRM total addressable market, and how large the Vault market was. Suhail also included questions for Deutsche Bank Equity Research on changes in total addressable market assumptions and subscription revenue models.

On 3-13-2014, Suhail commented on Veeva's Q4 2013 earnings in a 19-page report, noting Veeva's huge relative under-performance in the prior three months. Suhail said that the competitive landscape had stabilized and that organic seat growth would be extremely difficult going forward. Suhail also said that the Salesforce agreement renewal was a red flag due to the contract's timing and terms, and Suhail said that Veeva's claim that ""vertical"" was the ""new horizontal"" was going to be replaced by ""PAAS killed the traditional vertical."" Suhail said that Veeva remained grossly overvalued relative to peers and that 50%+ downside was imminent. On 4-2-2014, Suhail commented on Morgan Stanley's upgrade of Veeva. Suhail said Morgan Stanley's thesis was that Veeva's total addressable market would expand, but Suhail said that Morgan Stanley's estimated market was five times too large. Suhail said that sell-side analysts were entrenched in denial, and Suhail said that tech IPO space was ""rigged"" by underwriters and sell-side analysts.

On 4-10-2014, Suhail said that Interactive Medica had recently displaced Veeva in multiple territories of a top 20 pharma. Suhail said this meant Veeva was more vulnerable than originally thought, as Suhail said that Veeva had overstated its customer satisfaction. Suhail also noted that Deutsche Bank was attempting to shift the conversation to Vault and Networks potential, but Suhail said that the underwriter's analysis contained valuation mistakes. Suhail additionally questioned coincidences surrounding the timing of Veeva's IPO.

On 6-17-2014, Suhail commented on Veeva's Q1 conference call in regards to Veeva's total addressable market. Suhail also called into question a J.P. Morgan sell-side research report.

On 12-5-2014, Suhail noted that Sanofi had chosen to renew its CRM deal with Cegedim, which Suhail said was a major failure for Veeva. Suhail also said that Veeva's CRM business would experience a significant growth slowdown in 2015 when combined with accelerated CRM deployments pulled into 2014.

On 1-21-2016, Suhail said that it held a long position in Veeva shares. Suhail added that Veeva was previously its ""favorite"" short, but Suhail said that Vault growth had exceeded its expectations. Suhail also said that the unexpected future deployments of CRM at GSK and Sanofi would ensure that Veeva could sustain 20%+ top line growth through at least 2018.

Bleecker street said Small Cap Street, which had been involved and pumping other stocks, had pushed the stock up to unsustainable highs. Bleecker Street also said the company had declining user engagement and had a business that was ""unprofitable."" Sometime after Bleecker Street's original post (date unclear), Bleecker Street noted that Small Cap Street had written to Bleecker Street and denied being a stock promoter.","Viggle has been promoted by Small Cap Street, which also promoted PVCT.

Viggle user growth is already slowing, and it is disclosing fewer engagement metrics.

Viggle lost $96 Million in 2012 and lost $92 million in 2013. It will have difficulty turning this around.

CEO Sillerman's track record with publicly traded companies is poor.

There is currently 40-66% downside in Viggle shares, and it is an attractive short. The stock has done poorly since its IPO (uplisting) in late April, however, I believe that the stock is currently an excellent short as the company is struggling to gain traction with users and the stock has been promoted by several ""pump and dump"" newsletters. My Viggle short is not driven by the quality, or lack thereof, of the balance sheet. It is worth noting that the balance sheet is not particularly strong.

Bronte called Valeant a ""roll-up"" with ""accounts difficult to comprehend  which is not to say that they are incorrectly stated, just complicated by many acquisitions."" ValueWalk reported on the letter days later, giving it a wider audience.On 6-11-2014, Bronte began a series of posts criticizing the company's accounting practices. Also on 6-11-2014, Allergan rejected Valeant's offer.
The same day, Bronte Capital said it was skeptical of sales figures released by Valeant, which claimed an extremely diversified product mix. Bronte said the distribution was unbelievable, ""far more perfectly even than almost any real world distribution.""On 8-4-2014, Bronte Capital said Valeant had likely sold its facial injectables business for a ""startlingly cheap price"" at only 3.9x P/E, or else it had put out errant guidance for the coming quarter. On 8-11-2014, Bronte Capital continued to question the nature of Valeant's Galderma divestiture. Bronte questioned explanations by analysts that the Galderma sales force had remained with Valeant, as several Valeant statements at the time of the divestiture had stated otherwise. 

On 8-13-2014, Bronte questioned Valeant's claim behind the 40% drop in sales in its Galderma divestiture, arguing it would have taken an ""enormous"" decline ""all because of the machinations in Corporate America."" On 8-27-2014, Bronte said it was betting on ""not quite"" insolvency but on ""financial stress"" at Valeant, arguing that the company's audited accounts were not nearly as profitable as Ackman claimed they were.On 10-20-2014, Bronte Capital criticized Valeant for not releasing a balance sheet with its quarterly earnings, comparing the omission to Enron. On 9-29-2015, Bronte Capital responded in a blog post to Valeant's letter to employees. In it, Bronte Capital questioned the growth expectations of Salix and the company's denial that it relied on drug price increases. The blog post further noted the checkered history of the chair of the company's audit and risk committee.That same day, Bronte Capital commented on Valeant's earlier Q3 conference call. Bronte said that it appeared Valeant had financed Philidor and noted that Philidor had gone to the extent of alleged perjury to obscure who its underlying financiers were. Bronte added that the earlier conference call was the first time in any correspondence that Valeant had disclosed its relationship with Philidor, but Bronte questioned why there was no charge over Philidor holdings until late February 2015 if Valeant had effectively purchased Philidor in 2014. Bronte also said that Valeant likely used R&O Pharmacy because Philidor did not have a license to operate in California, but Bronte said that Philidor still shipped to California. Bronte said that Valeant appeared to be either involved in or the victim of a major fraud in regards to the $69 million R&O Pharmacy invoice, and Bronte added that Valeant's linked specialty pharmacies, which Bronte said were the key to Valeant's growth, had been compromised. Bronte also noted that Valeant was misleading about its business model in regards to patient assistance and cash pay.
On 10-26-2015, Bronte Capital said that Valeant used R&O to send prescriptions all over the U.S., including to states where R&O was not licensed, because the company had received rejections or audits from insurance payers when using Philidor's name. Bronte said that Valeant used the NPI number of another pharmacy, and the payers paid without audit, which Bronte said was classic mail fraud.On 10-30-2015, Bronte Capital said that Philidor could cause Valeant to collapse, and Bronte also said that its price target for Valeant was $0. Bronte said that the evidence was very strong that Philidor was a device to systematically defraud insurance companies, and Bronte said that it was unlikely that legal separation from Philidor was sufficient to protect Valeant from liability.On 11-18-2015, Bronte said that it was unlikely that Valeant had stuffed the channel in America but that insurance copayment issues were far more widespread than Valeant asserted, and Bronte also said that Valeant's channel stuffing in Europe had been confirmed.On 11-25-2015, Bronte said that Valeant's proxy captive pharmacies extended beyond Philidor. Bronte named 78 proxy pharmacies registered in Delaware, but Bronte said that related pharmacies also existed in other states. Bronte said that the registration of false pharmacies continued after Philidor was exposed and after Valeant said that it would stop doing business with Philidor. Bronte also said that the people on registration documents were also often on the pay roll of Valeant, not Philidor.Later that day, Bronte said that Valeant had not denied that the entities were set up either by Valeant or Valeant associates, and Bronte noted that ELO Pharmacy was registered in Illinois on 10-28-2015, which Bronte said was after the Philidor expose.

On 11-30-2015, Bronte said that a Valeant-associated pharmacy, Forsta LLC, had recently applied for a pharmacy license in Arizona, and Bronte said that Forsta's owner, Gary Tanner, was the Valeant employee who effectively ran Philidor day-to-day. Bronte questioned whether Forsta was another outsourced specialty pharmacy through which Valeant intended to run its business, calling it ""Philidor 2.0."" 
Later that day, Bronte said that Pearson emphasized Philidor's apparently ""meager"" contribution, but Bronte said that Philidor exceeded its entire 2014 total in the first quarter alone and that Philidor was responsible for 20.7% of U.S. branded drug sales in Q3 2015. Bronte added that even if only 50% of Philidors revenue was lost, the average price increase for U.S. branded Rx exceeded the remaining rate of organic growth, and Bronte said that volume growth without Philidor would be minimal or negative. Bronte also said that the vast majority of dollar growth in U.S. dermatology revenue during 2015 was effectively Philidor.Soon after, Bronte Capital commented on Valeant's earlier guidance. Bronte said that at the low end was a 13% revenue reduction, which Bronte said was about twice the revenue running through Philidor, and it added that ""something other than Philidor has been broken here."" Bronte also said that based on numbers in Valeant's 10-Q and its debt covenants, which Bronte said did not represent the numbers reported in Valeant's ""cash EPS"" measure, Valeant was operating under strict, loan-covenant based restrictions.
On 1-10-2016, Bronte commented on the earlier Bloomberg report about Norma Provencio. Bronte said that Valeant's press release in response to the article absolved Provencio from a long involvement in the fraud at Signalife, but Bronte said that Provencio was involved from the inception of the criminal business and that she was in business with Mitchell Stein from his first involvement. Bronte said that this time period was over two years prior to what Valeant had said, and Bronte concluded that either Provencio mislead Valeant or that Valeant was actively and deliberately misleading in its press release.On 1-14-2016, Bronte said that Provencio joining Signalife's board and audit committee matched to the month the start of outright criminal behavior at the company.

That same day, in its December letter to investors, Bronte said that it still held a short position in Valeant. Bronte added that the company was ""a potentially lethal mix of byzantine accounting,"" and it said that Valeant had ongoing legal issues, several years of rapid senior executive turnover and a large amount of debt. On 2-3-2016, Bronte said that the summary of Valeant's documents released the prior day contradicted the perspective on Valeant's price and volume strategy given in a Pershing Square presentation on 10-30-2015 and a Valeant conference call on 4-29-2015. Bronte said that Pearson knew growth was driven by price and said that Pearson lied on the conference call. Bronte also said that Valeant had systematically mislead Ackman into thinking that volume was the driver.On 2-10-2016, Bronte published two links to anonymous blog posts on the bear case for Valeant. The first post was from 8-13-2015 and was by an author called AZ Value, an entity that Valeant had addressed in its 10-6-2016 rebuttal. AZ Value's article discussed Valeant's accounting and disclosures for its acquisition strategy, and AZ Value questioned Valeant's opacity in confirming top line revenue numbers for the companies it had acquired. The second post was from 2-9-2016 and was by an author called commsense that had published to Seeking Alpha. Commsense discussed Valeant's cash needs for 2016 and said that Valeant was faced with an existing portfolio of drugs that would be challenged by generics, increased scrutiny from PBMs and politicians, the need for cash to execute its growth plans and significant cash requirements for payment of its growing current liabilities. It said that 2016 revenues were going to be much less than company projections.
On 3-12-2016, Bronte commented on a 3-5-2015 LA Times article that discussed Valeant's Zovirax cold-sore cream, which the LA Times said cost around $2,500 per tube under the U.S. healthcare system. Bronte said that it could not be long until Valeant got ""total payment kick-back.""

On 3-14-2016, Bronte published two questions for Valeant's 3-15-2016 conference call. Bronte questioned whether Valeant could break down the company's guidance for non-GAAP ""cash EPS"" into its estimated GAAP earnings and its budgeted non-recurring or non-cash expenses, as Bronte said that it appeared Valeant's business divisions could make their non-GAAP numbers by producing ""reasonable enough"" GAAP numbers and then marking ""inconvenient"" expenses as ""non-recurring."" Bronte also requested a list of broken debt covenants and a list of the consequences of those breaches.","One of the great bull stories of Valeant is how the CEO, Mr J Michael Pearson, is a ""hidden billionaire"" who can't sell any of his stock until 2017.Pledging has been used by several CEOs to effectively sell shares without fully disclosing the sales and sometimes in contravention of employment rules. ISS, a leading shareholder advisory service, has been targeting pledging and hedging of corporate stock as a governance issue for some time. Dodd Frank also made recommendations on the issue.

Chanos said Kynikos was long Allergan, and he said Kynikos had been shorting Valeant since before the Allergan offer.On 10-28-2014 in a Reuters interview, Jim Chanos criticized Valeant's accounting practices based on how it counted the value of drug companies it acquired.On 10-8-2015, Chanos said that he was still shorting Valeant Pharmaceuticals in an interview with CNN. CNN noted that Chanos had argued that Valeant's practice of buying drugs and then increasing prices was a far larger part of the company's business than it was willing to admit.
On 12-17-2015, in an interview with CNBC, Chanos said that he was still short. He said that Valeant's model did not work and he questioned who the payers were that paid the pricing for Valeant's dermatological drugs.
On 1-26-2016, Reuters reported that at Morgan Stanley's ""Breakers"" conference, Chanos said during a discussion with hedge fund investors that Valeant no longer had the drug pricing power it used to following scrutiny of its acquisition-heavy business model.",,Accounting Fraud,Too many acquisitions;Aggressive accounting;Insider selling;Growth unsustainable;Accounting misrepresentation;Strategy issues;business model pressure;Regulatory headwinds,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.",NYSE,fy2014,1,GV_029955,Bausch Health Companies Inc.,IQ345779,Pharmaceuticals,NYSE:BHC,322.6,8200,881,43,2203,1614,365.6,2203,145,2075.8,5997,78,2075.8,2026,0,889.2,246,-572,4131.7,0,-193,2290.2,1427,318,1312.3,2298,0,0,-966,0,20639.3,1188,0,26304.7,-134,2312,398,1054,-292,6.2,174,1492,0.9,880,-1102,0,0,0,2708.4,0,-179,15228,881,-19,0,0,-100,122.3,-442,19,20903,881,1630,0,881,1649,8349.2,2.62671,-28,-2397.8,2.62671,-3888,0,335.4,-3916,5279.4,2.58,17,5401.7,2.58,-44,26304.7,341.5,0,2.21676,0,2.17716,42795,42004,3912,0,334.40296,3912,-2460,336.20272,-277,(Invalid Formula 0me),2298,15.78754,3987,-15359.9,75,934,-45.93231,743.5,99,15235.1,0,-2267,7.1,16.5085,2040.375,15228,0,2577.25,14869.5,0,100,20636.8,151,3620,16800,23,540

Citron cited Valeant's escalating drug price as contributing to higher insurance and Medicare costs at the expense of U.S. taxpayers, while Citron also noted that Valeant had lower R&D spend than the average pharmaceutical company. Citron also noted that it was in the process of compiling a comprehensive dataset detailing Valeant's drug price increases at valeantpricing.com. Citron said that it believed Congress should move to subpoena Valeant about price rises to its drug portfolio, and Citron set a short term price target of $130. On 10-2-2015, Citron published the second part of its report. In the report, Citron said that Valeant raised prices on Isuprel and Nitropress the day after it acquired the two drugs in order to mask the impact of a bad Q1 2015. Citron estimated that the two drugs in question had added $86.95 million in revenue during the last 49 days of the first quarter and said that if Valeant had not increased the two prices, it would have missed the Q1 consensus EPS estimate by 9.22%. Valeant noted that the current controversy did not begin with Martin Shkreli's actions but with Valeant's bid for Allergan, when Morgan Stanley described Valeant a ""house of cards."" Citron also noted that the CEO's myth of ""double digit organic revenue growth"" was a lie and that the company's growth was unsustainable. Citron also said that Valeant had continued its price raising tactics, at the expense of patients and taxpayers, with its with newly-acquired Glumetza drug. Citron added that government action would simply expedite the company's business model failure. Citron lowered its short term price target to $125. On 10-21-2015, Citron Research published a report stating that Philidor owned R&O Pharmacy, and Citron said that the two were actually the same company with shared management. Citron said that this was an attempt at fraud to create invoices to deceive auditors and book revenue. Citron added that it appeared that Valeant/Philidor had created an entire network of phantom captive pharmacies in order to create phantom sales, to stuff the channel and to avoid auditor's scrutiny. Citron said it had lowered its price target to $50. The stock was down about 30% following the report. On 11-2-2015, Citron said that it would not be releasing new allegations against Valeant and that it would be moving on to new stories, and Citron said that it had passed all new information on to the mainstream media. Citron also noted the company culture's ""win at all costs attitude"" and questioned whether Valeant would be able to generate sufficient cash to service its debt load in the face of eleven specific headwinds. Citron also said that Ackman was analyzing Valeant with a model that he had not adjusted for declining cash flows from the end of price raising power and the consequences and reputational risk of the Philidor debacle, and Citron said that Ackman had omitted any change in financial analysis that showed changing conditions at Valeant accounting for increased scrutiny or declining sales in competitive products.","It is Citron's strong opinion that Pearson's hyper-sensitivity to his company's stock price is
typical of CEO's with something to hide. It was controversial for a while, but now the

Pearson's riskless arbitrage of return on drug assets and VRX's cost of capital wrecks havoc in the whole sector. Boom and bust will hurt innovation.

Public scrutiny on drug prices pressures asset returns, squeezes spreads.

Drop in Valeant's stock price and jump in bond yield will induce a death spiral. Valeant is not quite as mysterious as the fuzzy complex accounting methods would suggest.

The New York Times added that Wayfair had listed products from Ark Floors, a company which appeared to have sold laminate from some of the Chinese mills that had supplied Lumber Liquidators, and it said that Whitney Tilson's test results from five types of Ark laminate showed levels of formaldehyde above the emission standards set by the California Air Resources Board. Tilson additionally said that Wayfair's incompetence and out-of-control growth had resulted in the company selling the laminate seven months after the industry was aware of potential liabilities. Tilson said that the odds of the company ever reaching break-even were close to zero, and he said that he expected 90% downside. On 11-16-2015, at the Robin Hood Investors Conference, Whitney Tilson said that two out of three furniture products sold by Wayfair showed formaldehyde levels well above CARB2 limits, and he said that the company did not appear to have any compliance or quality control whatsoever. Tilson also said that Wayfair's management compensation scheme had artificially boosted adjusted earnings and free cash flow, and Tilson said that Wayfair's economics and gross margins would never materially improve. Tilson added that the company's business model faced issues from poor customer service, rising shipping rates and major competitive threats from Amazon and store-based retailers.

On 11-23-2015, Whitney Tilson said Wayfair had inflated reported adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow by minimizing cash compensation costs to its top executives, giving its top executives large stock/option grants and then instituting a Rule 10b5-1 automatic selling plan to convert the stock/option grants back into cash compensation, which Tilson said had also resulted in massive insider selling. On 12-3-2015, Whitney Tilson said that two more items of Wayfair furniture had failed the formaldehyde tests he commissioned. Tilson said that in total, nine of the 10 Wayfair composite wood products that he had tested had failed formaldehyde tests, and he said that he planned to test items of baby furniture next. Tilson added that it was likely a systemic problem and that Wayfair needed to suspend sales, confirm the test results, inform customers, launch a large-scale testing program and make a substantial investment in compliance.","I dont think the companys economics will ever improve materially (and could get much

The Street Sweeper also said that Boingo did not posses unique technology and that open source licensing terms could ultimately force the company to attempt to buy licenses, re-engineer its software or discontinue operations.","Shelf Registration: Boingo recently cleared the way so it can sell about 15 million shares, posing looming dilution of current stockholders shares.

Insider Selling: Executives are selling company stock like mad, suggesting a lack of confidence in Boingo. The CEO and chief financial officer alone have unloaded about 150,000 shares since June.

Accelerating Competitive Risk: Free mobile Wi-Fi offered by airports, coffee shops, hotels and telecom companies pose an ever-growing risk. Also depends on freely available open-source software and unlicensed spectrum.

Terrible Finances: Shareholders 2014 losses of $0.55 per share are expected to worsen to $0.77 per share this year.

The Street Sweeper said the CEO's clever management of his shares both pre- and post-IPO had made him extremely wealthy, though likely at the expense of investors and the company. It also said that the company's printer was ineffective, extremely expensive, and did not stack up well against competitor 3D printers, even in light of bubble valuations across the industry. The Street Sweeper said the company's price-to-earnings ratio of 2000-plus would be unsustainable.","The chief executive and his interests get far more money under this deal than the company itself.

It's roughly $100 million for him versus $72 million for the company.XONE reported proceeds of about $92 million from the initial public offering in February. But about $16.6 million of this went into Mr. Rockwell's pockets through his entities for things such as land payments, and repayment of loans and one entity's entire debt. He also sold more than $10.2 million of stock in the IPO.But we think the company faces more share-zapping storms, particularly since we believe its technology is inferior. Indeed, TheStreetSweeper's sources have talked with representatives of companies that bought XONE's machines. And some don't even use them. Additionally, one aeronautics company uses XONE for prototyping but reported it likely wouldn't buy another machine because - like the stock itself - they are too expensive at up to $1.4 million.Market leader 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) just stepped out in front with its plan to get printers into homes and small businesses. In May, Staples announced it became the first major retailer to stock 3-D printers when it began selling DDD's Cube for $1,300. Japan's huge retailer Yamada Denki also began selling the Cube.The company just sells a few of its expensive units in a quarter. By a few we mean four.

That's right. XONE sold only four printing machines in the second quarter. That's the number sold the previous quarter, plus a cheaper laser machine sold in the first quarter. The previous quarter, eight machines were sold. XONE primarily blamed European weakness in 1Q and yen weakness plus two machine sales that fell through in 2Q.",Product ineffective,Product ineffective;Managerial self-dealing;Product not as valuable as perceived;Bubble industry;Growth unsustainable;Competitive headwinds;lackluster product and sales,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,ExOne Company,Nasdaq,fy2013,1,GV_017012,The ExOne Company,IQ225890957,Industrial Machinery,NasdaqGS:XONE,98.445,39.48,-6.455,0,23.907,2.372,98.445,23.907,0,9.042,15.573,0.711,9.042,16.102,0,12.764,5.127,-0.823,123.548,0,-8.083,37.868,0,-1.1,32.772,-5.656,-3.707,0,-0.372,0,0,-5.93,0,158.435,-0.017,-20.192,1.748,-5.947,-19.311,0,0.37,0,0.127,-6.317,0,0.549,0,-2.327,8.734,0,0,2.082,-6.455,0,0.475,0.152,-21.638,0,-0.017,0,11.735,-6.607,0,0,-6.607,0,0.144,-0.51463,-10.413,-6.455,-0.51463,-7.65,0,12.83823,-18.063,146.7,-0.51463,156.031,146.7,-0.51463,0,158.435,12.83823,0,-0.29944,0,-0.29944,42451,41639,-3.284,-0.456,14.38761,-3.284,137.512,14.42511,95.643,(Invalid Formula 0me),-5.656,10.19627,-2.212,146.7,1.072,0.31,10.19627,-3.84425,1.334,3.233,0,-18.063,0.676,NM,-32.3695,2.557,NM,-32.137,-95.212,0,12.374,149.933,0.37,-22.595,190,0,383

To be clear, we are in no way suggesting, or even implying, that ExOne management even knows who this ""group"" is, and we have no reason to think ExOne management has done anything wrong.

Citron argued that the company was not poised to grow and expand further beyond its current market share, citing the company spending nearly 44% of its revenue on sales and marketing in the previous quarter. Citron suggested most realtors have heard of Zillow and that opportunity for further growth by selling leads or ads to realtors was limited. It also noted a flattening of page views and middling responses in surveys about the usefulness of Zillow's online ads. Citron said Zestimates, Zillow's home price predictor, was gimmicky, frustrating to realtors, and ultimately did not add real value for the company's customers. Citron also noted insider selling and a lack of disclosure on some financial metrics. On 11-27-2012, Citron Research released a short follow-up report. In it, Citron again noted friction between realtors and real estate databases over the way houses are listed. Citron said rules around how the company could list much of its data would be changing on 1-1-2013, limiting its options and forcing it to more prominently list brokers and agents. Citron also noted another $6 million in insider sales in just the last two months. On 9-20-2013, Citron released another follow-up report to explain Zillow's meteoric rise and why the stock price would fall back down again. It reiterated many of the previous arguments it had made in its initial report, including inside sales, an outsized marketing and sales budget, and no meaningful way to monetize the company's internet traffic further. Citron emphasized that Zillow only had 13.5% of all real estate web traffic, demonstrating how much traffic would continue to go through local, trusted real estate agents. Citron also noted how little in profit the company has actually made over its seven year history.

On 6-27-2014, Citron released a fourth report since its initial short in September 2012. Citron said a recently announced ""marketing partnership"" with Douglas Elliman Real Estate Company in New York City showed just how conflicted the company's business model was as ""Elliman shouldn't be Zillow's marketing partner-they should be...one of its largest customers!"" Citron said Elliman would sell the same real estate without Zillow but that ""Zillow would be irrelevant"" without Elliman in New York City. Citron stressed that the ""unique flaw"" of Zillow is that ""its customers are also its content providers."" On 7-26-2014, a Saturday, Citron Research published an article criticizing both Zillow and Trulia, saying that the proposed combined entity would not have the pricing power to ""triple ad revenue from real estate agents,"" as analyst commentary had suggested. Citron said Zillow and Trulia were operating in an unsustainable competitive landscape, noting that Zillow and Trulia had a ""rock bottom deal"" with Realogy that prohibited all other agencies from advertising on their listings. On 7-24-2015, Citron Research, in a follow-up report, offered ten reasons why Zillow would be trading below $40 in the next year, including the values of other lead generation companies, the CEO's request to view the company in ""decades,"" the CEO's dumping of shares, the departure of the CFO, and lost customers among other factors.","Zillow has been unable to make a real profit in one of the largest real estate booms in history -- with less competition than it faces now.

","Conclusion

The bottom line is that investors need to realize that a company with nearly no cash and assets that total only $200,000 has a ZERO chance of innovating in an energy industry that sees over $100B expended by the best and brightest scientists and engineers the world has to offer. The true purpose of this entire production is to sell worthless shares at artificially inflated prices to unsuspecting investors.

Even the most naïve of retail investors should find it a little unnerving that nearly 10 years ago this same exact company was sued by the SEC for engaging in nearly an identical fraud that left investors with nearly $200 million in losses.

We urge investors to stay away from ZERO as we predict that the shares will follow the path of all five of our recently profiled companies which experienced an average decline of nearly 60% from the time our report was published. And for those investors that are still skeptical we urge you to please read the SEC case vs. ZERO in its entirety as we are certain it will change your minds.",Other information,rejected -- not U.S.-listed.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"Save the World Air, Inc.",OTC/Pink,fy2012,0,GV_115411,"QS Energy, Inc.",IQ2434322,Oil and Gas Equipment and Services,OTCPK:QSEP,1.60179,0,-13.09239,0,6.97734,0.03608,1.60179,6.97734,0,0,-6.97734,3.94042,0,0.21064,0,0,0.96318,0,1.64192,0,0,0.30471,0,-0.53551,0.05567,-8.15115,0,0,-3.62773,0,0,-15.77726,0,1.70793,2.68487,-4.51759,0.41135,-13.09239,-0.01614,0,0,0,0,-13.09239,0,0,0,0,4.60545,0,0,0,-13.09239,0,0,0,-0.01614,0,0,1.83584,4.60545,-13.09239,0,0,-13.09239,1.83584,0.14367,-0.10175,0,-82.38185,-0.10175,0,0,128.66739,0,-2.89752,-0.10175,3.68188,-2.89752,-0.10175,0,1.70793,128.66739,0,-0.07664,0,-0.07664,42079,41274,-8.11508,0,143.66757,-8.11508,5.51772,148.93307,0.98399,(Invalid Formula 0me),-8.15115,-0.02017,-7.90444,-2.89752,0.21064,0.00764,-0.02017,-9.86079,0,0,0,1.83584,0,0,1.14449,0,0,-0.20827,-1.60179,0,-0.92584,-2.89752,0,-8.13122,10,0,254

Technology uses Sleeping Beauty, an older way of putting genes into cells to kill tumors. The method may be safe, a doctor says, but may be because its less effective.

This technology fell behind at the get-go. Novartis leads the field of rivals with CAR-T cancer therapy and it would take years of catch-up for Ziopharm to gain FDA consideration.

Ziopharm has quite the promotional history, increasing chances that this experimental technique also won't develop into a commercial product. Ziopharm will likely soon be looking for a new story.

Shkreli said that one of Zalicus's main assets was royalties from Covidien for a pain drug called Exalgo, but he said that sales seemed to have peaked and that royalties would be worth $0.25 per share were sales to double and then peak. He added that the other of Zalicus's main assets, a drug called Synavive, was worthless and flawed in its biological rationale. Shkreli noted that Synavive had failed its COMET-1 study for osteoarthritis in 2008, and he said that the drug would also fail its SYNERGY study. Shkreli added that Zalicus said it held a composition of matter patent on Synavive's drug combination but that the company did not invent the drugs in question. He said that he valued the rest of Zalicus pipeline, including ion channel drugs, at $0.25 until they entered the clinic. Shkreli estimated 90% downside and fair value of shares of about $0.50 to $1.00. On 11-9-2011, Shkreli announced that he was closing his recommendation to short Zalicus. Shkreli added that he thought the company would continue to trend lower, and he said that Synavive was still worthless, that Exalgo was generating limited royalty reserves, and that the company was running out of cash.","The company claims they have a composition of matter patent on the combination of two extremely old drugs.

Although the report was released on 2-29-2016, it did not receive attention until Muddy Waters Research linked to the report on Twitter on 3-7-2016 (3-6-2016 New York time). Ghost Raven, a new and anonymous short-seller, said Celltrion's actual revenues were 90% below claimed revenues (""nearly 100% of sales are fabricated through a controlled related party,"" Celltrion Healthcare). Celltrion sent its report to Celltrion's auditors and Korean regulators, and it said Celltrion's true value was ""a small fraction of its current stock price.""

On 3-8-2016, Celltrion said that the report was ""false,"" and the company said its Remsima product had been officially approved in 70 countries and was ""selling in the global market through reliable partner companies such as Pfizer and Mundi Pharma.""","To all it may concern,We are writing to inform you that we believe that we have uncovered a massive accounting fraud at Celltrion Inc., larger in fact in terms of market capitalization than Sino Forest at its peak. While accounting issues were raised by the Wall Street Journal in 2012, those concerns were

never fully investigated by the ?nancial community. Since that time, the ?nancial manipulation at Celltrion has aggressively expanded, and Celltrions stock price has appreciated ~300% in the last 3 years to a ~$9 billion market capitalization. Ghost Raven Research represents an anonymous team of researchers and forensic investigators. We have uncovered numerous frauds in various geographies across the world prior to their exposure in the media. We are short Celltrion shares and will pro?t from a decline in the companys share price.Through our analysis of Celltrion and its subsidiaries audited ?nancials through 2014 (we do not have access to 2015 audited ?nancials for all Celltrion subsidiaries yet), we believe that Celltrion today has actual revenues ~90% below what they claim, and operating expenses more than 50% above what they claim. The true ?nancial picture is that Celltrion is a tiny company burning tons of cash, with way too much inventory and way too much debt. Were Celltrion to report accurate ?nancial statements, we believe it would collapse as one of the largest frauds in world history. Moreover, even based on fundamentals alone, we think the stock is overvalued by more than 50%.We invite you to view our research as well as primary source documents that we have translated from Korean to English. For the avoidance of doubt, we believe that we do not have any material non public information. For our ?nancial analysis, we are relying primarily on the annual audited ?nancial statements of Celltrion and its subsidiaries.We believe our analysis, supported by primary source documentation, stands for itself and do not currently intend to continually update the market on our latest thoughts regarding Celltrion. We believe that we have provided suf?cient information and analysis for the market to make up its own mind regarding Celltrions future and will allow other analysts to carry the torch forward in writing this story. As the world reviews our analysis, we are certain that some analysts will quibble over certain of our assumptions, and perhaps pundits will uncover a few immaterial errors here and there (we have reviewed thousands of pages of ?nancials after all, and we do not claim perfection). However, when all is said and done, we believe the market will agree with our overarching conclusions: Celltrion is misleading the market by overstating its true revenue and earnings, Celltrion burns cash, and Celltrion is overlevered. A common tactic of companies accused of fraud is to attack the messenger in an attempt to discredit the authors claims. We think that a better use of Celltiron managements time would be to directly address our core claims and to conduct a third party review of its ?nancials by a globally recognized accounting ?rm that is not currently on the audit payroll, such as Ernst & Young. While we currently do not intend to publish further reports on this company, if Celltrion engages us with frivolous lawsuits, then we reserve the right to publish further reports on Celltrion in the coming weeks. Future research topics might include:1.A detailed analysis of Celltrion and its subsidiaries audited 2015 ?nancials upon their release.2.An analysis of Celltrions 2015 quarterly ?nancials. We ?nd it fascinating, for instance, that no one on the sell side has bothered to pull the Remisa global monthly sales data provided by IMS and compare those ?gures to Celltrions reported quarterly 2015 revenue numbers.3.A deep dive on growing biosimilar competition and why we think its unlikely Celltrion replicates its ?rst mover success beyond Remicade.We believe that given the lack of any meaningful long-term earnings power, Celltrion will eventually be unable to service its debt and may eventually be delisted, going down as one of the largest accounting frauds by market capitalization in the history of the world.

It said that the SAIC filings of Sinosofts key operating entity in China, Nanjing Skytech, showed that its revenues and profits were much lower than reported in both London and Hong Kong. Zhongkui also said that Sinosoft's revenue from its export tax rebate segment was inflated and that it was exaggerating its e-government revenue. Zhongkui said that Sinosoft was inflating its carbon management business and fabricating its software procurement cost to drain the company's faked cash.

Later that day, the company halted its stock pending news and announced a conference call.

On 12-29-2016, Sinosoft said that Zhongkui's report made allegations that were groundless and contained ""various misrepresentations, malicious and false allegations and obvious factual errors."" It responded to six of Zhongkui's allegations, and it said that it had applied for the resumption of trading.

Later that day, the company's shares resumed trading.

Glaucus said that the company lied about the volume of water treated at its facilities and as a result had misrepresented its reported revenues and profitability. Glaucus said that the company claimed that its Xintao facility operated at 100% utilization but MEP data suggested that it operated at 54% utilization between 2012 and 2014. Glaucus said that the company fabricated the financial performance of one of its acquisitions and that it had found evidence that the company had dealings with the former chairman of China Metal Recycling, a company that Glaucus exposed as a fraud in 2013. Glaucus estimated that based on MEP data and other evidence the company's revenue had been 30% less than reported.

Later the same day, CT Environmental announced that it had commenced a trading halt, pending the release of an announcement in response to the allegations that had been made against the company.","CT Environmental Group Ltd (HK: 1363) (CTEG or the Company) primarily engages in industrial wastewater treatment and hazardous waste disposal. In a crowded and heavily regulated industry where prices are typically set by the Chinese government, CTEG has reported margins far in excess of its competitors. It claims that its success is driven by its business model of building, owning and operating wastewater treatment facilities (the BOO model). In this report, we present publicly available wastewater treatment data from the Chinese government which directly contradicts CTEGs reported wastewater treatment volumes at two of its primary facilities. In our opinion, this is clear and irrefutable evidence that the Company has lied to the investing public about the volume of water treated at its facilities and as a result, its reported revenues and profitability. This report also presents SAIC filings and other government records showing that, in our opinion, CTEG has engaged in undisclosed related party acquisitions of companies secretly connected to its Chairman. Shockingly, we have found evidence of intimate dealings with the former chairman of China Metal Recycling, which Glaucus exposed as a fraud in 2013 (report available here) and which was subsequently liquidated by Hong Kong regulators. When we consider the totality of the evidence, we conclude that the Company is materially misrepresenting its reported financial performance and that its management is so untrustworthy that CTEG is simply uninvestable. But to be conservative, we value CTEGs shares at HKD 0.38 per share, an 82% downside from the current share price. Given that CTEGs debt levels have ballooned to RMB 2.3 billion in 1H 2016, we believe that it is reasonable to expect even further downside pressure on the Companys shares. 1. Inflation of Reported Wastewater Treatment Volumes. Because wastewater treatment is a highly regulated business, the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) publishes an annual list of the volume of wastewater processed at key facilities in China. This data directly contradicts the Companys reported figures for the utilization of two key facilities. a. Xintao. CTEGs Guangzhou Xintao Industrial Park Treatment Facility (Xintao) is the Companys primary wastewater BOO facility, with total design capacity for wastewater treatment of 100,000m³ per day. CTEG claimed that Xintao operated at 97%, 99% and 100% capacity utilization in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. But the MEPs National Urban Sewage Treatment Facilities Lists state unequivocally that the Xintao facility only processed 54,400m³ in average daily volume in 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively. These lists are published annually, are unambiguous and are corroborated by other sources. In our opinion, the lists clearly indicate that the Company overstated the amount of wastewater processed at the Xintao facility by more than 82% from 2012-2014. b. Yinglong. MEP data shows a similar exaggeration of actual wastewater treatment volumes at another key facility, the Guangzhou Yinglong Wastewater Treatment Company Limited (Yinglong). Yinglong, also operated by CTEG using the BOO model, has a treatment capacity of 100,000m³ per day. CTEG disclosed that Yinglong operated at 73%, 80% and 90% capacity in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. However, the MEP data states that Yinglong only treated 49,300m³ of wastewater per day in 2012, and only 53,800m³ in 2013 and 2014. This data indicates that CTEG overstated the amount of wastewater treated at the Yinglong facility by over 54% in those three years. c. Profit Overstatement. MEP data indicates that the Company significantly overstated the utilization rates and therefore the volume of water processed at its two key BOO facilities. Because CTEGs wastewater treatment segment from its BOO facilities is the Companys primary driver of profitability, we estimate that CTEGs gross profit from its BOO segment was 67% less than reported for that segment from 2012-2014",Other information,accounting fraud,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,CT Environmental Group Limited,Hong Kong,fy2016,0,,CT Environmental Group Limited,IQ134679495,Water Utilities,SEHK:1363,1155.849,2177.038,605.69,6.525,1182.685,255.89,1162.374,1182.685,17.429,666.901,994.353,3.965,1025.15,281.495,0,26.515,0,-74.548,2351.713,0,6.903,3152.936,0,-165.933,2696.799,896.926,-0.31,9.969,-97.342,0,1614.302,737.214,0,7663.483,-17.429,852.761,108.106,719.785,-719.397,0,119.552,5.991,1171.223,600.233,-67.86,0,0,0,1776.232,0,0,2000.619,605.69,0,0,0,-805.457,11.538,0,379.093,4047.421,605.69,1945.313,0,605.69,2324.406,157.92,0.09607,-275.765,2355.581,0.09607,-1074.916,0,6304.775,-1350.681,3604.524,0.09607,0,3616.062,0.09607,-23.846,7663.483,6304.775,0,0.07395,0,0.07395,43220,42735,1152.816,-133.37266,6316.792,1155.219,664.092,6316.792,699.285,(Invalid Formula 0me),896.926,0.57063,1170.958,1990.222,18.142,101.057,0.31507,466.21575,82.715,3171.842,0,973.725,1171.223,16.6094,34.81736,2000.619,22.0199,99.10299,2009.468,0,10.27677,6787.904,140.093,433.419,1941,-20.541,769

Hongqiao Exposed said that Hongqiao reported significantly higher margins than its peers but still produced negative free cash flow. Hongqiao Exposed said that a large part of the company's negative free cash flow appeared to be transactions with undisclosed related parties and either, the disclosed margins were too good to be true and the capital expenditures could have been a means to offload fake profits or that the margins had been accurate and the acquisitions could have been a method to embezzle money from the company. Hongqiao Exposed said that the company's negative free cash flow since 2010 had been funded by debt which amounted to CNY¥67.7 billion.

On 11-23-2016, the company said, in a response to Hongqiao Exposed's report, that the allegations were one-sided and were misleading speculation. The company said that its board would release a detailed response to rebut the report and clarify the allegations.","China Hongqiao Group Limited (Hongqiao) is the largest producer of primary aluminum in the world with 5.2 million tons of nameplate capacity1 . Despite consistently reporting significantly higher margins than primary aluminum peers, Hongqiao produces negative free cash flow, which has led to the build-up of RMB 67.7 billion of debt2 . In the first half of 2016 alone Hongqiao raised an additional RMB 13.8 bn of debt, bringing the companys total debt to EBTIDA level to 4.5x3 . A large part of what has contributed to the negative free cash flow in recent years are acquisitions which appear to be transactions with undisclosed, related parties. There are two possible explanations here: 1) If Hongqiaos margins are in fact, too good to be true, then Hongqiaos large capital expenditures may be a mean to offload these fake profits. 2) Hongqiaos margins may be real and higher than all aluminum peers and related parties are using these acquisitions to embezzle money from the company. The first scenario appears to be the most likely explanation for the events which have transpired since the second explanation would suggest that close to one-fifth of the companys market capitalization was misappropriated by a group of rogue middle managers. Either way, Hongqiaos shareholders and bondholders will then be left holding the bag. Hongqiaos Hong Kong-listed shares, show just under RMB 9 BN non-insider ownership. Hongqiao is covered by sell side firms such as Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Macquarie and HSBC, who have failed to question these undisclosed, related party dealings. Hongqiaos debt book runners are a slate of foreign banks (Deutsche Bank, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, and Morgan Stanley) who similarly failed in their diligence process, giving the bonds the stamp of approval for distribution to investors around the world..

Glaucus said that the cumulative profits of Tech Pro's most profitable business segment Shanghai Fuchao were actually 99% less than reported from 2011-2015 and its net asset balance was 99% less than reported as of FYE 2015. It also said that the company had overstated the purchase price of Shanghai Fuchao by 99% and had overstated the profitability of four acquired LED subsidiaries by 100%. Glaucus said that Tech Pro was an ""obvious fraud"" and that trading of its stock should be halted.

Later that day, Tech Pro said that it vigorously denied Glaucus' allegations and said that the report was ""incomplete, biasedly-selected and presented and materially misleading."" Tech Pro also said that it would clarify and address the allegations in due course.

On 7-29-2016, the company published a further response to Glaucus. Tech Pro responded point-by-point to three accounting allegations from Glaucus' report, and it said that the company had not overstated the profitability and inflated the purchase price of Shanghai Fuchao. The company also said that Glaucus' allegation that Tech Pro had fabricated the profitability of its LED business did not take into account the contributions of the subsidiaries' Hong Kong holding companies and the differences in timing to recognize income and expenses under HKFRSs.","Tech Pro Technology Development Limited (HK: 3823) (Tech Pro or the Company) is a rollup of unrelated businesses: it manufactures and sells LED lighting products, it is a sub-leasing agent for a commercial real estate property in Shanghai, and it recently purchased a French soccer team. In this report we present publicly available SAIC filings, which, in our opinion, indicate that Tech Pro has massively overstated its reported profits and inflated the reported purchase price of its acquisitions. We believe that Tech Pro is an obvious fraud, that its equity is worth HKD 0.00 and trading of its stock should be halted to protect future investors from further losses and hopefully provide a modicum of recovery for shareholders and creditors. 1. Fabricated Financial Performance of Shanghai Fuchao. In 2014 and 2015, Tech Pro reported that Shanghai Fuchao Property Management Company Limited (Shanghai Fuchao), a sub-leasing agent for a commercial real estate property in Shanghai, generated cumulative net profits of RMB 60.9 million, making Shanghai Fuchao its most profitable business segment and its most valuable asset. In aggregate, Tech Pro claims that Shanghai Fuchao generated net profits of RMB 190 million from 2011 through 2015, and retained a net asset balance of RMB 733 million as of FYE 2015. However, financial statements contained within SAIC filings indicate that Shanghai Fuchaos cumulative profits were 99% less than reported from 2011-2015 and its net asset balance was 99% less than reported as of FYE 2015. In our opinion, this is clear and convincing evidence that Tech Pro has lied about financial performance of its most profitable business segment and its most valuable asset. 2. Fabricated Purchase Price of Shanghai Fuchao. On November 27, 2013, Tech Pro announced its intent to purchase 50% of Shanghai Fuchao for a total consideration of HKD 450 million. However, SAIC filings of Shanghai Fuchao reveal that the actual purchase price was only RMB 4.5 million, 99% less than Tech Pro claimed. We believe that this is clear and undeniable evidence that Tech Pro massively inflated the purchase price of its acquisition and thereby blatantly violated Hong Kong securities laws. 3. LED Businesses: Fabricated Profitability of Acquired Subsidiaries. In 2011, Tech Pro acquired five LED related businesses for a total consideration of RMB 781 million. Each acquisition included a profit guarantee for the first twelve-months post-acquisition, to reassure investors that Tech Pros acquisition binge was a responsible investment. Tech Pro reported that the five LED businesses generated profits of RMB 98 million in the first twelve-months post-acquisition. However, SAIC filings for four acquired LED businesses reveal that actual profits during the twelve-month minimum guaranteed performance period were 100% less than Tech Pro reported.

Well Investments asked how Jig-Saw planned on achieving its ambitious technological goals given extremely low capital expenditures, and it questioned Jig-Saw's accounting and financial statements. Well Investments also questioned various insider transactions, and it gave Jig-Saw stock 95% downside. The next day, Well Investments posted an English translation.

On 5-13-2016, Jig-Saw announced Q1 2016 earnings. Shares closed down about 25% on 5-16-2016.

On 5-31-2016 Tokyo time, Well Investments published a full 32-slide presentation on Jig-Saw. Well Investments said that the company's main and ""probably only real business"" was computer server maintenance and network monitoring, which Well Investments said was a low-tech business in decline. Well Investments also said that fact distortion had driven the company's stock, and it added that the company's hyped ""partners"" did not acknowledge Jig-Saw. Well Investments also said that Jig-Saw made frequent but vague announcements on new acquisitions and tieups that were immaterial, and it additionally questioned Jig-Saw's lack of capex, no R&D and suspiciously low employee wages. Well Investments said that the company could not articulate its strategy, business model or product set, and it said that fair value was 91% below the current share price.","Jig-Saw        claims         to         be         a         cutting-edge         tech company         that        is        involved        in

Hsin Chong has been OCF negative in each of 2013, 2014, 2015 and interim 2016, and recently cut its long-standing dividend. We have serious concerns over its substantial debt obligation... We believe that Mr. Lin Zhuo Yan, the current non-Executive Chairman, is using Hsin Chong as his personal dumping ground for problematic and non-revenue generating development properties at the expense of minority shareholders. Since 2011, Hsin Chong has acquired a number of development properties that were either owned by Mr. Lin or his wife, or can be directly linked to Mr. Lin. This report will present the evidence  including site visit photos and satellite images  that lead us to believe that two of the Companys biggest property acquisitions have languished for years while Hsin Chong continues to mislead investors about the commercial viability of these properties. Each year, Hsin Chong claims that monetization of these properties is just around the corner, but we can find no evidence that this is true. In one case, Hsin Chong spent ~HK$4 billion on the acquisition and construction of a property that sits empty as one of Chinas notorious ghost towns in a location that Bloomberg calls Ground Zero of Chinas Slowdown. In another case, Hsin Chong spent HK$5.9 billion on a property that has been sitting idle for years, having failed to attract international brands and commercial tenants. Relative to Hsin Chongs HK$ 3.5 billion market cap, these acquisitions were substantial in scope. Furthermore, both of these properties were acquired from vendors that included Mr. Lin and his wife, at vastly inflated prices relative to their original purchase price. These acquisitions have burdened Hsin Chong with significant share dilution and increased debt which we believe have led to a host of other problems with the Company, including: Based on Company disclosures, we estimate Hsin Chong will pay well over HK$700 million per year in cash interest expenses alone. As of the most recent reporting period, the Company only had HK$1.1 billion in cash on its balance sheet. sin Chong has been both operating cash flow negative and investing cash flow negative in each of 2013, 2014, 2015, and interim 2016. In order to preserve funds, Hsin Chong has suspended its long-standing dividend. Based on our research, we believe Hsin Chong is having serious problems monetizing its land bank.

Triam said that Skycomm was an undisclosed related party and a key business partner to the company, which Triam believed was being used as an off-balance sheet vehicle to manipulate the company's financial performance. Triam said that potentially 73% of the company's assets were fake.

Later the same day, in response to Triam's report, the company announced that trading in its stock had been halted.

On 12-18-2016, the company announced the resumption of trading in its stock and also issued a response to Triam's short report. The company said that all the allegations made against it were false and questioned Triam's intentions for publishing the report.

On 12-20-2016, Triam said, in a response to the company's rebuttal of its original report, that the company's response failed to answer adequately the issues raised in the original report. Triam said that the company's response indirectly revealed that company's revenues were fabricated. Triam said that the company had confirmed in its response that chairman Chan Yuen Ming remained vice chairman of Guangdong Skycomm and legal representative of Shaanxi Skycomm.

Later the same day, the company said, in response to Triam's rebuttal, that Triam's response contained untrue, groundless and misleading allegations and that it denied the allegations.

On 12-28-2016, Triam Research said in a second rebuttal that China All Access had continued to lie and deceive in its two clarification announcements, and Triam said that the company's 2015 financial statements remained unreliable, among other issues. It also said that there had been blatant stock price manipulation and a false market in the company's stock after it came off suspension on 12-19-2016.","China All Access (Holdings) Limited (HK: 0633) (CAA or company) is Hong Kong listed with a market cap of HK$ 4.48 billion.

FABRICATED REVENUES.
In this report we present evidence based on public information and field research, which, in our opinion demonstrates that CAA has fabricated RMB 1 billion in core business revenues (36% of total revenues).
UNRELIABLE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.
KPMG resigned and HLB Hodgson Impey Cheng Limited was appointed as the new auditor in October 2015. There are inexplicable discrepancies between the 2015 annual results announcement accepted by the auditor and the annual report published a month later. There were significant discrepancies in the breakdown of assets and the income statement. Additionally, how can anyone trust the financials when there is only one large customer accounting for over 10% of CAA's revenues in the results announcement  but three more appear in the annual report, including two which together account for 34% of CAAs sales? Bizarrely, the largest customer in the results announcement accounts for RMB 1,240 million of CAAs revenues but then only RMB 609 million in the annual report. Such discrepancies were not seen in prior years with KPMG.

Muddy Waters also said that the company showed effectively no organic growth over the prior four years, despite having projected that its organic growth CAGR would be 11.4%. Muddy Waters added that the highly aggressive accounting the company employed to boost reported profitability made its failure to hit targets even worse and made trends in its automotive business look more favorable. It also said that Nidec's acquisition strategy was more effective at masking weak organic growth than at creating value.

Later the same day, the company, in response to the the allegations, said it concluded that Muddy Waters' statements were factually inaccurate.

On 12-20-2016, Nidec announced an expansion of its share repurchase plan to up to JPY 50 billion or 5,000,000 shares of common stock.","Muddy Waters Capital LLC (Muddy Waters) is short Nidec, and we value its shares at JPY 4,764. We view Nidec as a gigantic stock promotion. The companys management, led by Mr. Shigenobu Nagamori, repeatedly give uber-bullish predictions about Nidecs business, and then massively misses them. Nidec missed a three-year forward sales projection by 29%. The company missed its 2015 sales target of JPY 2,000 billion by 41%, and now tells investors that number is its 2020 target. Nidec missed a two-year projected overall operating profit target by 27%. Nidecs track record with short, medium, and long-term projections in its Automotive product group seems even worse.

On top of the arbitrariness of Nidecs projections, we calculate the company showed effectively no organic growth over the past four years, despite having projected its organic growth CAGR during this time would be 11.4%. Instead, we calculate that Nidecs actual organic growth (ex-currency effects and M&A) CAGR from FY 2011 through FY 2015 was only 0.05%. The quality of Nidecs earnings growth seems poor. We estimate that effective tax rate reductions have boosted Nidecs reported EPS by 11.4% since FY 2013. Given Nidecs meager top line organic growth, it is probably fair to say that the vast majority of the remainder of Nidecs reported EPS growth has been due to currency effects and M&A.

Analysts and investors appear to have gone blind from staring at The Man Hotter Than the Sun. (This is a reference to Mr. Nagamoris self-published comic book about himself.) Sell-side analysts heap praise on the company, and write about their expectations for future organic growth as though Nidec were a completely different company. At the same time, they remain oblivious to the incessantly missed predictions. As a result, Nidecs sky high valuation implies a valuation for its non-HDD businesses close to that of Facebook, Inc., which is one of the strongest consumer brands in the world, generates 35%+ organic growth, and generally converts a much higher percentage of its operating cash flow to free cash flow than Nidec does.

Nidecs failures to meet targets are made even worse by the highly aggressive accounting the company employs to boost reported profitability, and make the trend in its automotive business look more favorable than it really is. Nidecs JPY 36 billion in write-offs seem unjustified, and could have been improper. According to the company, the write-offs boosted reported profit by JPY 10 billion to JPY 15 billion per year. Nidec has transferred businesses into the Automotive group in ways that misleadingly flatter the Automotive groups results. Furthermore, we have interviewed four former employees who have attested to Nidec Automotive group salespeople in China stuffing the channels (thereby improperly boosting reported sales). Nidecs auditor probably offers little safeguard against misleading accounts  in our opinion, Nidecs auditor is to audit failures what Michael Jordan was to basketball.

Part of the myth underpinning Nidecs valuation is a notion that it is a superior acquirer of businesses. We think Nidecs acquisition strategy is more effective at masking weak organic growth than at creating value, and we see the extent to which it generates synergies as greatly overestimated. While Mr. Nagamori speaks publicly about buying companies such as Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723 JP) and Calsonic Kansei Corp. (7248 JP), he makes some highly questionable purchases, such as a recent acquisition of a small Romanian company from a convicted felon. Former employees of some of Nidecs acquisition targets question the thoroughness of Nidecs due diligence, and the notion that there were synergies with Nidecs existing businesses. At the time Nidec announced it was acquiring Ansaldo Sistemi Industriali S.p.A., Mr. Nagamori brushed aside the rare analyst question about whether Nidec would be able to achieve its goal of generating a 10% operating profit margin in the business. The most recent financials we have for that entity show that its OP margin halved since around the time of acquisition to 2.8%. Nidecs reasons for acquiring minority stakes in six formerly listed subsidiaries are unclear, but we note that Mr. Nagamori received JPY 29.5 billion in Nidec shares (at todays share price) for his ownership of these companies.

Nidec in our view unduly promotes business opportunities with sex appeal, such as haptics (which led to a write-off), robots, drones, and LIDAR. These exciting products account for a tiny sliver of Nidecs overall business, and in our view, have received an inordinately large amount of attention from investors. Nidecs margin on sales of drone motors to Amazon.com (AMZN US) is likely to be significantly compressed once any scale is achieved.

We have real corporate governance concerns about Nidec. There are indications that management is able to override internal controls. Mr. Nagamoris receipt of Nidec shares worth today approximately JPY 29.5 billion for his stakes in subsidiaries raises questions, as does the JPY 14.5 billion loan he received from the company, which was repaid a few months later by mostly selling his Nidec shares to the company. It is disconcerting that Nidec was unable to hold onto Bunsei Kure, while the companys Chief Technology Officer, Mikio Katayama, was instrumental in running Sharp into the ground.",Overvalued by markets,stock promotion;strategy issues;organic growth overstated;too many acquisitions,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Nidec Corporation,Tokyo,fy2016,0,,Nidec Corporation,IQ882937,Electrical parts,TSE:6594,305942,1178290,89945,2010,909953,60964,307952,909953,237,234989,268337,0,253373,98460,0,170874,51978,-5163,755091,0,-6176,728741,0,-6897,346932,117899,0,18797,-423,0,239092,117401,0,1376636,-237,147659,177297,117164,-81898,81092,26166,1417,80504,90998,-9665,2273,0,0,419659,0,0,130323,89945,1319,6475,0,-95377,8346,0,32412,605267,89945,37903,0,89945,70315,87784,303.04102,0,625168,303.04102,-26210,-12111,296.808,-26210,763023,301.92923,0,771369,301.92923,-12133,1376636,297.891,0,243.66804,0,242.78218,42905,42460,178863,-23690,296.60102,178864,7775,296.60102,36040,(Invalid Formula 0me),117899,2572.55686,181745,523931,2882,1797,1766.45041,72322.625,24468,300667,0,44105,163869,22.3327,57981.5,136798,26.3383,59440.875,-7285,0,-2702,1072036,24018,96965,96602,2148,778

It said that at least JPY 81.7 billion of SMC's cash might not exist, or almost 25% of its total cash, and it said that around JPY 55 billion of inventory write-downs should be expected. It also said that questionable accounting techniques had not only masked the true status of SMC's inventory and cash balances but also concealed evidence of its deteriorating business fundamentals. Well Investments said that once the company appointed a reputable audit firm with global reach, SMC would see significant material restatements to its accounts.

Later the same day, the company, in response to Well Investments' report, said that its stand alone and consolidated financial statements had been audited properly.

On 12-14-2016, the company said, in a follow-up response regarding Well Investments' report, that the 81.7 billion yen of missing cash refereed to in the report could be accounted for by considering the cash balances of subsidiaries marked as ""N/A."" The company said that it carried a large inventory in order to provide quick delivery to customers and that contrary to the claims that had been made in the report it was not the case that the company carried useless inventory.

On 12-15-2016, Well Investments said, in response to SMC, that the company barely addressed the key issues it had raised in its original report. Well Investments said that SMC conveniently claimed that the missing cash was in the U.S., Hong Kong, Taiwan and Brazil, but Well Investments said it was unlikely that the entities held any significant cash. Well Investments said that it would not be difficult to verify its subsidiaries cash balances and asked when it could expect to see notarized copies of cash balances for the remaining subsidiaries. Well investments asked why SMC used small local auditing firms overseas and why are they had been replaced on a haphazard basis. Well Investments said that the company's response to it having held excessive inventory was negligible and asked why U.K. accounting rules on inventory are not applied to the rest of the group.","Abstract

Muddy Waters said that since 2014, the company had reported fraudulent profits largely based on the lie that it was substantially self-sufficient in producing alfalfa and Muddy Waters said that it had found evidence that the company had purchased substantial quantities of alfalfa from third parties. Muddy Waters said that it believed that the company had engaged in CapEx fraud related to its cow farms and estimated that the company had overstated spending on the farms by up to RMB 1.6 billion. Muddy Waters said that the company appeared to be on the verge of default due to excessive leverage and said that although the company had a real business, its massive leverage caused it to conclude that its equity was close to worthless. Muddy Waters said that it visited the company's facilities and found that two announced production sites had no evidence of construction.

On 12-16-2016, the company announced, in response to Muddy Waters report, that it had halted trading in its shares.

On 12-19-2016, Muddy Waters published a follow-up report on China Huishan Dairy Holdings Company Limited that said that a significant portion of the company's revenues were fake. Muddy Waters said that when China Huishan first went public a large amount of its fake revenues were based on massively inflated milk yields from its cows, which it said was suspicious as the living conditions of the company's cows were of poor quality - which it said usually indicated poorer yields. The short seller said that China Huishan had later changed the story behind its fake revenues from high milk yields to an online ""sales miracle."" Muddy Waters said there was little evidence of an online ""sales miracle,"" and calculated the online revenues of its main competitors, Mengniu and Yili, to be 1500x that of China Huishan's.","We are short China Huishan Dairy Holdings (6863 HK / Huishan) because we believe it is worth close to Zero. We conclude Huishan is a fraud. In this first report on Huishan, we detail the following conclusions and supporting facts. Since at least 2014, the company has reported fraudulent profits largely based on the lie that it is substantially self-sufficient in producing alfalfa. We found overwhelming evidence that Huishan has long purchased substantial quantities of alfalfa from third parties, which gives us no doubt that Huishans financials are fraudulent. We believe Huishan has engaged in CapEx fraud related to its cow farms. We estimate that Huishan has overstated the spending on these farms by RMB 893 million to RMB 1.6 billion. The primary purpose of the CapEx fraud is likely to support the companys income statement fraud. Chairman Yang appears to have stolen at least RMB 150 million of assets from Huishan  the actual number is quite possibly higher. The theft relates to the unannounced transfer of a subsidiary that owned at least four cow farms to an undisclosed related party. It is clear to us that Chairman Yang controls the subsidiary and farms. Even if Huishans financials were not fraudulent, the company appears to be on the verge of default due to its excessive leverage. Taking Huishans financials at face value, its credit metrics are horrible. The leverage is so substantial that in FY16, Huishans auditor appears to have stopped just short of issuing a going concern qualification. Given that we conclude Huishans reported profits are fraudulent, we have no confidence that Huishan can make it through the next year without defaulting. There are clear signs of enormous financial stress, including the types of financing Huishan is trying to employ and halted projects.

Citron said that despite Cyberdyne's valuation and hype, the company did not lead the exoskeleton market niche in either sales or research, and it said that Cyberdyne trailed behind all of its formidable competitors. Citron added that the company had yet to effectively commercialize any product, and it noted catastrophically declining growth in the company's core technology and product. Citron also said that the company's investment in R&D was virtually non-existent and that the company did not own the patents underlying its IP, and it said that Cyberdyne had no regulatory approvals and no presence in the world's largest market.

Later, Cyberdyne said that the ""relevant research report"" differed greatly from the companys perspective and that Cyberdyne expressed ""its displeasure by this research reports use of numerous inflammatory expressions that could mislead investors, factual errors, and emphasis on certain facts while ignoring other relevant information."" Cyberdyne said that it would announce its view in the coming days and also would consider a legislative response.

On 8-19-2016, the company published a point-by-point rebuttal to five of Citron's allegations. Cyberdyne said that Citron's report was missing crucial details regarding the company and also included several incorrect statements. Cyberdyne also said that Citron's analysis did not fully comprehend the company's business characteristics and inappropriately grouped its products with other ""exoskeleton"" devices that had different abilities, purposes and target markets.

companies -- BUT CYBERDYNE IS NOT ONE OF THEM. Far from the great
Japanese companies that have transformed the automobile industry and
pioneered the video game industry, Cyberdyne is an example of a company that
is taking advantage of the naiveté of retail investors and lack of open
information about stocks in the Japanese stock market. Citron Research has no

It said that Itochu should not be permitted to consolidate profits from CITIC under the equity method, which it said had inflated the company's projected profits by 20%. Glaucus also questioned the company's ¥60 billion (after-tax) one-time gain recognized on the reclassification of its minority investment in Ting Hsin, which it said had saved Itochus FY 2015 earnings, and it said that ITOCHU likely would be forced to restate its financials.

That same day, ITOCHU commented on Glaucus' report and said that its accounting treatment was appropriate.

Later, ITOCHU released a second statement in response to Glaucus' report and said that the company had applied appropriate accounting treatment in regards to its Colombian coal company investment, consolidation of CITIC and investment in Ting Hsin.","In 2015, Toshiba Corp. (TYO: 6502) admitted to deliberately manipulating its accounting policies in order to overstate its profits by USD 1.2 billion (¥152 billion) from FY 2008 to 2014. Toshibas stock declined 70%, Japanese securities regulators imposed a record fine, and Toshibas CEO and 8 of its 16 board members resigned in disgrace. The Tokyo Stock Exchange even placed Toshibas stock on alert, raising the possibility that the Companys stock could be delisted if it failed to correct deficiencies in its corporate governance. In our opinion, Itochu Corporation (Tokyo: 8001) (Itochu or the Company) will likely become the next Japanese company to be forced to restate its financials and admit to accounting impropriety. In FY 2016, Itochu surpassed traditional giants Mitsui & Co. and Mitsubishi Corp. to claim the title of Japans most profitable trading company. Itochus rise has been startling: since the appointment of Masahiro Okafuji (Okafuji) as president, Itochus net income has risen 87%. We believe that Itochus record profits are merely a mirage. We have conducted a thorough review of the publicly available information, and we believe that Itochu overstated FY 2015 net profits by inappropriately reclassifying its stake in a Colombian coal mining JV to intentionally avoid taking a ¥153 billion impairment when the value of the investment had declined significantly. Furthermore, we do not believe that Itochu should be permitted to consolidate profits from CITIC under the equity method, given that CITIC is operated and majority-owned by the Chinese government, meaning that it is highly unlikely that Itochu can have any significant influence over CITICs strategy, operations or policy-making. Deconsolidating CITIC would mean that Itochus forecasted net profits would fall by 20%. We are also highly suspicious of the ¥60 billion (after-tax) one-time gain recognized on the reclassification of its minority investment in Ting Hsin, given the suspicious timing of the gain and the declining profitability of the investment. We do not find it credible that Itochu magically discovered a ¥60 billion one-time (after-tax) gain only four weeks before the end of FY 2015, when Itochu was set to miss guidance by ¥60 billion. Toshiba was almost destroyed by a scandal for overstating earnings by ¥152 billion over seven years. We believe that in FY 2015 alone, Itochu may have overstated net profits by ¥153 billion by reclassifying its coal mining investment without recognizing an impairment to its consolidated accounts.

In the report, Well Investments said that Marubeni's aggressive accounting was no longer sustainable and that major writedowns of up to ¥150-200 billion were inevitable, as Well Investments said that Marubeni deliberately avoided its obligations under IFRS accounting rules in recognizing asset impairments. Well Investments additionally said that the forthcoming writedowns would be highly problematic for Marubeni from a credit perspective, and it said that the company was the most levered of all Japanese trading companies. Well Investments also noted that due to regulators' awakened interest in impairment delays, Marubeni could face a ¥5.1 billion fine.","This report will show that Marubeni has failed to recognize material asset
impairments of large overseas commodity and agricultural investments. Once the
market recognizes these substantial losses there is material downside to the stock
price. We estimate asset impairments of ¥150-200 billion (US$1.2-$1.7 billion)
and a 40% downside price target for the stock price. Based on Toshiba Corps

Anonymous said that the company had valued property purchased in Shanghai at RMB396 million through an internal credit assessment, but an SAIC filing had valued the property at RMB244 million six months prior; Anonymous said it believed that the property was purchased at an inflated price as a means of funneling money out of the company, while the revaluation gain was recognized to inflate earnings. Anonymous said that Credit China was a company with a share price value dictated more by end-of-day trading manipulation than business fundamentals.

Later the same day, the company announced that it had halted trading in its stock in response to allegations that had been made against the company.

On 12-21-2016, the company issued a response to the short report published by Anonymous Analytics that refuted the short-seller's allegations against the company. Credit China denied that its acquisition of Shanghai Jifu was an undisclosed related-party transaction and that China UCF was not actually a controlling shareholder in Shanghai Jifu. The company also defended its acquisition of Hefei Jianxin.

Later that day, Anonymous Analytics wrote a follow up report on Credit China's response. Anonymous Analytics said that Credit China's clarification that China UCF was not a controlling shareholder was unlikely to be true. Anonymous Analytics also said that Shanghai Jifu may have used UCF's third-party payment licence to report income generated by Shanghai Jifu as Credit Chinas profits - effectively reporting profits derived from undisclosed related-party transactions.

Also on 12-21-2016, Credit China's shares resumed trading.","Credit China is a US$2 billion company engaged in the provision of traditional short-term loans andinternet-based financial transactions. Credit China is currently listed on the alternative board of theHong Kong Stock Exchange, but is looking to be promoted to the Main Board, which the Company claimscan happen as early as this month.Based on our research, we believe that Credit China has misled investors by engaging in a number ofquestionable or otherwise undisclosed related-party transactions designed to funnel money out of theCompany and/or inflate earnings. Among them: The Acquisition of Shanghai Jifu:   The largest acquisitions in Credit Chinas history as a publicly -tradedcompany occurred in April 2016 when it acquired a 35% stake in a company called Shanghai Jifu for cashand stock consideration of RMB856 million. The Company claims Shanghai Jifu was an acquisition fromindependent third-parties. However, our research suggests that it was an undisclosed related-partytransaction involving a key individual of Credit China. The Shanghai Property Purchase:  In December 2013 Credit China purchased a property in Shanghai forRMB396 million from a purportedly independent borrower who had defaulted on a loan. In the threeweeks following the foreclosure but prior to year-end 2013, Credit China recorded a revaluation gain of approximately RMB76 million. This gain represented 37% of Credit Chinas 2013 reported pre -tax profitof RMB207 million.Credit China claims that it arrived at the RMB396 million valuation through an internal creditassessment. However, SAIC filings show that the property had been valued at RMB244 million only sixmonths prior by an accredited national class one property valuer. Based on the fact pattern, we believethe property was purchased at an inflated price as a means of funneling money out of the Company,while the revaluation gain was recognized to inflate earnings. The 30-Minute Trade:  Credit China trades at a comparatively nose-bleed multiple of 45x 2017 earnings,while its closest competitor trades at less than 10x. Inspired by the Financial Times  analysis  of Hanergys unusual trading patterns, we have conducted an analysis of the intraday trading patterns of Credit Chinashares for the past six months. According to our analysis, a strategy of buying Credit China shares at3:30pm and selling at 4:00pm would have seen HK$100 grow to HK$219.31 versus a buy-and-holdstrategy over the same period of HK$128.62. There were only two other stocks in our review of HongKong-listed companies that performed better in the last 30 minutes of trading.Accordingly, we think Credit China is just another company with a share price value dictated more byend-of-day trading manipulation than business fundamentals",Accounting Fraud,accounting fraud;related party transactions;auditor weakness,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Credit China FinTech Holdings Limited,Hong Kong,fy2016,0,,Chong Sing Holdings FinTech Group Limited,IQ115832306,Consumer Finance,SEHK:8207,1233.391,859.052,301.122,0,0,18.675,1256.893,0,0.999,3469.688,859.052,109.986,3836.007,373.475,0,0,0,0,5544.929,0,0,66.5,0,0,45.076,378.813,0,1253.474,0,0,1179.363,425.465,0,8862.513,1.22,-527.334,0,426.685,-38.367,303.58,84.438,0,903.297,342.247,-232.292,0,0,-0.007,1901.276,0,-64.133,2628.606,301.122,-219.093,0,0,-779.311,45.737,0,0.488,4620.933,301.122,3061.905,0,301.122,3062.393,358.259,0.01482,-9.775,924.229,0.01482,-963.58,0,20314.05307,-973.355,4195.843,0.0143,19.133,4241.58,0.0143,0,8862.513,21023.02557,0,0.01107,0,0.01069,43187,42735,0,0,21523.672,0,1905.477,21523.672,618.376,(Invalid Formula 0me),0,0.19494,0,3016.48,19.715,111.327,0.14015,224.79063,52.841,3835.483,0,2089.038,1206.877,19.7893,0,2628.606,0,0,2578.59,137.986,0,8077.063,82.596,0,837,1.842,785

roll-up that came public in 2007. Bowing to pressure from an activist to maximize shareholder value, URS Corp (URS) sold itself
in October 2014 to AECOM (for approx. $5bn  a cash/stock deal which included the assumption of $1bn in URS debt). The
URS deal is the largest in AECOMs history. AECOMs pro forma leverage at closing of 4.4x was forecasted by the Company to
decline to 2.0x by 2017 due to strong free cash flows  a claim Spruce Point will put to rigorous scrutiny!
 The URS deal was touted as giving AECOM heft in the oil and gas market, at exactly the wrong time! As shown by the
investor presentation, URS also added exposure to the mining and industrial sectors  other areas that have shown persistent
weakness since 2014
 The company predicted 25% accretion to Cash EPS and noted $250m of synergies. Commenting on the deal, analyst Will
Gabrielski of Stephens (ironically now AECOMs VP, IR) said, You couldnt have had a better marriage of two companies that
complement each others skill sets, scope and capabilities so well. They both have the federal government as a large customer,
but there is very little overlap in what they do, he said. Its a great value for both companies.",Overvalued by markets,macro issues affecting industry;acoounting misrepresentation,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,AECOM,NYSE,fy2016,1,,AECOM,IQ701179,Construction and Engineering,NYSE:ACM,692.145,17410.825,96.109,0,16768.001,398.73,692.145,16768.001,0,4531.46,642.824,73.406,4578.525,115.088,0,0,0,337.291,6000.771,0,0,1220.992,0,16.616,644.992,527.736,-22.949,330.485,-249.982,10.014,6303.282,381.786,0,13669.936,-256.231,814.155,1910.915,125.555,-191.386,26.303,-37.917,54.622,340.021,163.472,-5.534,0,0,39.699,5304.756,0,0,3702.157,96.109,-60.016,0,0,-162.615,185.568,-213.642,0,10117.447,96.109,4706.225,0,96.109,4706.225,1.539,0.62097,0,618.445,0.62097,-5199.961,0,154.772,-5199.961,3366.921,0.62,38.138,3552.489,0.62,-25.892,13669.936,156.073,0,1.10649,0,1.09726,43417,42643,926.466,0,153.9015,1030.498,-637.979,153.94762,8.252,(Invalid Formula 0me),527.736,21.87712,1310.166,-2936.361,383.7,216.125,-19.07948,171.25325,13.109,4068.481,0,-493.736,366.324,NM,1000.13975,3702.157,0,1153.742,3376.336,0,-516.357,7620.97,72.2,735.08,87000,-110.1,791

Kerrisdale said that because of this promotion the company was now significantly overvalued with a price-to-NAV multiple of 5.8% compared to the industry median of 1.9%. Kerrisdale said that it was implausible for the company to generate enough additional value to justify its current valuation.","First Majestic Silver Corp. is, in the words of its founder and CEO, the purest silver company in
the world, with six operating mines and a handful of development projects, all located in
Mexico. Like any miner, First Majestic has seen its market value fluctuate in sympathy with the
price of its key commodity; from the peak of the silver market in 2011 to its recent low point, for
instance, First Majestic declined 90%. As precious-metal prices have rebounded, however, First
Majestic has gotten a new lease on life, rising 268% year-to-date  an increase eight times
larger than that of silver itself.
This speculative frenzy  exacerbated by an ongoing, company-funded stock-promotion
campaign  has gone too far: First Majestics valuation is now outrageously detached from
reality. We estimate that the company trades at 5x net asset value (NAV)  an astonishing
premium to peers and a gross violation of common sense. While the market prices other
precious-metals miners at just 17% of the spot value of their measured and indicated mineral
resources  gold and silver in the ground that still need to be extracted, processed, and sold
over many years, justifying a large discount  First Majestic trades at a whopping 77% of this
value. Not only is the company ludicrously expensive relative to its peers; its also expensive
relative to its own history. For example, compared to the last time the price of silver was at its
current level, First Majestics stock price is now 17% higher  yet its silver reserves per share
are now 30% lower.
Indeed, as First Majestic has surged higher, even sell-side analysts with bullish views on the
price of silver and the prospects of the silver-mining industry have expressed bafflement over its
valuation. Among the eight firms covering the company, not a single one believes its trading
anywhere close to NAV. But First Majestic has benefited from less sober investors seeking the
cleanest play on a silver bull market and buying at any price.
Contributing to the hype is First Majestics CEO, a former stock promoter who describes himself
as a high-level visionary and for years has predicted  incorrectly  that silver would soon
trade for over $100 per ounce (up from ~$19 currently). He has also opined that the financial
crisis of 2008-2009 was completely orchestrated andknown by the insiders (as a way for
banks to buy cheap real estate in probably the largest theft in human history) and contended
that if we actually do see negative interest rates in North Americawere going to see riots.
While he argues that current precious-metal prices are unsustainably low as a result of paper
manipulation by a conspiracy of big banks, whats really unsustainable is First Majestics
anomalously high share price, which we believe has 70-80% downside.",Overvalued by markets,stock promotion;unsavory management;pump and dump;inappropriate valuation methods,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,First Majestic Silver Corp. ,NYSE,fy2016,1,,First Majestic Silver Corp.,IQ3110160,Silver,TSX:FR,129.049,278.077,8.601,1.437,149.281,81.182,142.737,149.281,0,6.353,128.796,4.403,16.473,17.747,0,20.254,0,7.362,180.199,79.593,2.828,1111.152,0,-8.469,628.047,26.223,0,0,-3.141,-4.903,0,23.971,0,857.175,1.52,100.012,10.752,25.491,-62.46,0,16.89,0,12.378,8.601,0,6.078,0,0,49.572,0,0,31.56,8.601,-3.605,2.108,0,-66.586,0,0,0,235.474,8.601,49.87,0,8.601,49.87,628.565,0.05346,0,-63.218,0.05346,-63.206,0,160.87404,-63.206,621.701,0.05,65.087,621.701,0.05,0,857.175,164.25756,0,0.09313,0,0.09121,43130,42735,107.405,0,164.46157,107.405,44.826,164.46157,78.031,(Invalid Formula 0me),26.223,3.78022,0,621.701,0,6.925,3.78022,14.98188,4.719,52.124,0,-13.336,18.456,66.2586,34.40888,33.668,0,36.48638,-90.613,3.324,3.028,673.825,8.346,44.945,4003,8.544,795

K2 said that total gold mined would consistently underperform compared to Asanko's mine plan.

Later that day, Asanko said that it completely refuted K2's claims, and the company said that it stood by its 2016 production guidance, its resource estimate and its life of mine plan.","? Asankos mineral reserve estimate implies the ore zones expand dramatically beneath the old
Nkran pit. The previous miner said it was in fact becoming thinner and more discontinuous.
? Asankos DPP Whittle analysis suggests they can take the previously mined ~38Mt Nkran pit, mine
over 114Mt more along the same ore structures, and the average strip ratio will be less than the
previous miner achieved on the first ~38Mt
? In 2000, the previous operator, Resolute Mining restated their gold estimate for the Obotan

? The Companys current resource estimate contains ~6x more gold ounces than the previous
miners stated resources before they forfeited the asset
? We estimate half the gold is present compared to the Companys reserve estimate at Nkran
? To match Nkrans gold reserves, we have to exclude large quantities of barren/NSR drill intercepts

Unfortunately for shareholders, the description is a lot more impressive than the company's outlook from a historical or forward perspective. In reality, AMBR's TTM revenue is <$70MM, and the CEO has been leading this ""Global Trade Leader"" since August 1988. In other words, the company's software isn't new and disruptive.

Citron Research further noted that the CEO's rapid rate of insider selling should put investors on notice.

On 11-8-2010, the company announced a public offering of 4.6 million shares of stock. A few days later, the company said it expected to net $155.1 million from the offering.

On 3-14-2011, the company announced it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire The Switch Engineering Oy, a power technologies company based in Finland, for approximately $265 million.

On 1-20-2016, The Street Sweeper said that AMSC's wind turbine business model was irreparably harmed after it lost both the control of its own technology and a 70% contributor to revenue in 2011. The Street Sweeper added that the company's customer Sinovel was indicted in June 2013 for theft of trade secrets for secretly copying AMSC's intellectual property. The Street Sweeper also said that a recent strategic announcement with Inox Wind Limited was ""baseless"" and failed to help AMSC's $921.9 million in operating losses. The Street Sweeper questioned whether Inox could develop its own solution like Sinovel, and it also noted AMSC's declining revenue over the prior three years.

On 8-9-2016, the company reported Q1 earnings for fiscal 2016. Its shares closed 23% lower that day.","The chief executive of American Superconductor Corp. (NASDAQ: AMSC) nailed it when he told a reporter that China wanted to kill the company.

In fact, shares collapsed under Chinas pressure, plunging the market valuation by 87 percent virtually overnight in 2011. And despite misunderstood hype that has breathed a quiver of life back into AMSC in the past few weeks, the stock appears poised for another hammering.

In a 60 Minutes segment broadcast Sunday night, CEO Daniel McGahn said AMSC lost over $1 billion in valuation when China looted its wind turbine technology in a high-stakes game of industrial espionage.

Back in 2007, AMSC agreed to supply the computer brains for wind turbines made by small, China-based Sinovel. Two years later, AMSC announced a $100 million follow-on contract with Sinovel. In 2010, the year it hyped a partnership expansion, AMSC broke its string of losses and knocked down $16 million in net income, thanks to the Chinese company.

*Business Disappears Overnight

But in March 2011, those celebrated contracts fell apart. Sinovel, a 70 percent contributor to AMSCs revenue, suddenly refused contracted deliveries of the companys turbine controls.

Oddly, it seemed Sinovel turbines were spinning when they should have been shut down during testing. Thats when the company began investigating. It seemed an employee had secretly copied AMSC's intellectual property, including source code. Six months later, Superconductor filed suit claiming it had been left in a lurch and its IP stolen.

Lured by promise of a $1.7 million contract and other perks, a Superconductor insider agreed to steal the technology for Sinovel, according to a criminal indictment.

In June 2013, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Sinovel, two former executives and a former AMSC employee with theft of trade secrets.

*The Kicker

Incredibly, the FBI discovered stolen technology right under AMSCs nose.

FBI agents found a Sinovel wind turbine - complete with AMSCs heisted technology - just 40 miles away from company headquarters in Devens, Massachusetts.

The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority had purchased the turbine from Sinovel for $4.7 million  - in federal stimulus money.

Undaunted, Sinovel punched back with a $190 million counterclaim in China over issues including failure to meet contract standards.

So the civil proceedings between AMSC and Sinovel rest in the court in Beijing, another complicating factor for the American company.

Its a very complicating factor, I think evidenced by the fact its been four years and weve havent seen much movement at all, Brion Tanous, AMSC investor relations, said in a phone interview with TheStreetSweeper.

Of course, AMSC's four civil lawsuits remain unresolved - one initial trial date has been set for December - and the ultimate  expenses remain unknown.

One thing is certain, though. In one fell swoop, AMSC lost its biggest customer  and control of its technology.

TheStreetSweeper believes theres a nagging danger that other companies may be willing to take a turn at kicking AMSC in the chops, too 

*Inox Agreement: Hype, Numbers, Security Questions

AMSCs recent hype over $210 million strategic agreements with India-based Inox Wind Limited hopped up the stock price.

The agreement revolves around an integrated power electronics system that includes a wind turbine power converter cabinet, internal power supply and controls.

But there are three red flag-waving issues here.

**First, long-time customer Inox is now responsible for about 60 percent of AMSCs revenue  or about $52.2 million this year.

The December Inox deal specifies the arrangement will be worth $210 million over the next three to four years. That means about $52.5 million per year.

But Inox is already contributing that amount right now, anyway.

Indeed, AMSCs Mr. Tanous confirmed that.

Yes, the actual revenue from Inox for the first two quarters are certainly in public documents in the 10-Q. We havent said anything about the composition of revenues for Q3, he said.

He added that AMSCs growth opportunity links to Inoxs intentions to double its megawatt capability over time.

Whether there is growth in this strategic agreement would depend on the demand that Inox sees, said Mr. Tanous.

**Second, the agreement details surrounding Inoxs wind turbines in India contain an exclusivity clause, as disclosed in the 8-K.

Technology License Agreement

On December 16, 2015, the Company and Inox entered into a Technology License Agreement (the License Agreement). Under the License Agreement, the Company has agreed to grant to Inox (i) an exclusive license to use the Companys technology (not including the source code) to internally manufacture and supply ECS only for use in its Wind Turbines in India, and (ii) a non-exclusive license to use the Companys technology to manufacture, distribute and supply ECS only for use in its Wind Turbines in the rest of the world (together, the License). The grant of the License will become effective after Inox makes an advance payment under the Supply Contract and the upfront payment under the License Agreement discussed below. The License granted to Inox is subject to the limits on the number of ECS permitted to be manufactured by Inox as set forth in the Supply Contract.

Under the License Agreement, Inox is required to make payments to the Company in the aggregate amount of $12 million to be paid as follows: (i) an upfront payment to the Company of $6 million within thirty (30) days after execution of such agreement, and (ii) an additional $6 million as milestones are satisfied over the fifteen-month period from the License Agreement effective date.

That licensing agreement prevents AMSC from selling its product to any other wind turbine makers in India. So that limits growth prospects there.

AMSC would be precluded from selling that design to another Indian company, though a different design could be sold, said Mr. Tanous.

Third, we wondered about the security of that contract.

Can Inox jump up and develop their own solution much like what happened with Sinovel? If so, with Inox already accounting for over 60 percent of revenue, AMSC could find itself facing the sort of revenue-killing, stock-killing action it endured when 70 percent revenue-generator Sinovel turned on AMSC.

Mr. Tanous assured us that the contract is secure.

Sinovel did not develop anything. Sinovel stole the technology. AMSC has years and years of experience and its extremely difficult to copy what theyve done(Due to safeguards) it would be extremely difficult to steal the technology again, Mr. Tanous added.

For the trouble of attending a few meetings, the directors rake in between $50,260 to $85,260  well above the average Americans wage of about $42,000 per year.

""It's certainly something on our minds,"" said Mr. Tanous.

But Mr. Tanous asserts that a combination of three areas hold the key to AMSC someday making a buck: wind technology (the company thinks it may be headed toward profitability); quality systems for the electric grid (AMSC hopes to double revenue to reach the 2012 level prior to the Australian market weakness) and high-temperature superconducting grid cables (currently no revenue but AMSC hopes a Navy contract could grow).

Unrelenting storms have broken the wings of AMSC's wind turbine business model and we dont believe it can pull off a turn-around. But we do believe the next gust may well drop the companys share price to about $2.70  a very fair valuation.",Competitve Headwinds,industry saturation;customer losses;insider selling,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,American Superconductor Corporation,Nasdaq,fy2016,1,,American Superconductor Corporation,IQ34933,Electrical parts,NasdaqGS:AMSC,39.33,96.023,-23.139,0,74.041,7.972,39.33,74.041,0,19.264,21.982,3.248,19.264,28.861,0,18.512,12.303,-9.318,83.341,0,-0.782,117.267,0.157,1.543,49.778,-19.339,7.248,0,-1.037,0,0.854,-23.061,0,135.318,2.313,-4.559,5.837,-20.748,-1.201,0,2.391,0.047,2.624,-23.139,0,0,0,3.092,41.007,0,0,1.367,-23.139,0,0,0,4.873,0,-0.779,0,51.769,-23.139,0,0,-23.139,0,0.141,-1.75588,0,-928.184,-1.75588,-4,-0.881,13.178,-4,83.549,-1.76,22.312,83.549,-1.76,-0.11,135.318,13.178,0,-1.09373,0,-1.09373,43257,42460,-11.367,0,14.05562,-11.367,18.202,14.04584,18.84,(Invalid Formula 0me),-19.339,5.94417,-9.739,82.695,1.628,0.709,5.88341,-14.41313,1.723,3.991,0,-4,2.624,NM,-7.383,1.367,0,-6.73488,-35.339,1,5.043,87.54,2.409,-12.568,369,-0.018,799

Citron said that AveXis also faced the anticipated Spring 2017 approval of Biogen/Ionis's competitor drug with overwhelming safety and efficacy data, and it said that the FDA drug designation of ""breakthrough therapy"" did not grant automatic validation of AveXis' drug candidate.

On 12-27-2016, Mako Research said in a follow-up report, saying that a recent press release from AveXis indicated even more trial delays for the company. Mako said that the real reason for the press release was the company's inability to file its intrathecal route of administration IND with the FDA, and it added that competing product SPINRAZA was approved on 12-23-2016 for shipment in the following week, which Mako said represented the ""nail in the coffin"" for inferior AVXS-101.","Rarely in biotech do we see a situation where an investor can simply perform their own due diligence and be on the right side of the trade without needing to be a scientist. In the case of AveXis (NASDAQ:AVXS), all you need is a healthy dose of skepticism, willingness to do the research, and a bit of empathy to reveal that there's nothing here beyond a glorified stock promotion. It will soon trade in the single digits. The hopeful story of a cure for terminally ill babies is powerful enough to bring forth the worst of Wall Street's greed, which has the power to sell this story to investors despite the absence of real clinical data. If it wasn't for the horrendously warped way the US pharma market prices its drugs, AveXis could not even have completed its IPO. The background of this story is exposed in an excellent piece published a month ago. Citron unhesitatingly recognizes good quality research and therefore credits Mako Research with a carefully done profile on why AveXis is nothing more but a stock promotion being orchestrated by highly questionable management.

I believe AveXis (NASDAQ:AVXS) is a company with a single drug pipeline destined for failure, suggesting AVXS stock is a terminal zero. This conclusion is based upon a thorough review of the supposed scientific ""data"" presented by AVXS, which I find to be flawed and troublesome. Specifically, AVXS's trial was conducted at a highly controversial, single center location, by a research scientist previously connected to several highly controversial studies, including a recent study where the FDA publicly called for a retraction. Prior efforts from this research scientist flamed out under fraud allegations and patient death. Furthermore, AveXis founders and the people behind the company have numerous past and current lawsuits, including fraud allegations against John Carbona, the company's founder and ex-CEO.

Jason Galanis Controlled COR, BANC's Founding Shareholder. SEC documents detail how Galanis gained control of COR portfolio companies to orchestrate the Tribal Bonds Ponzi Scheme. Galanis laid claim to Banc of California to display his financial wherewithal and even managed the scheme out of an office in the same building as BANC's headquarters.
An Off-Balance Sheet Lender Controlled By BANC's Senior-Most Officers Financed Galanis. Steven Sugarman holds an undisclosed interest in Camden Capital, an off-balance sheet lender controlled by BANC's Vice Chairman, Jeffrey Seabold. Camden was used to finance Galanis amidst the recent Tribal Bond Scheme and engaged in transactions with Galanis during the Gerova Financial fraud.
BANC's Lead ""Independent"" Director Has Strong Ties To Galanis. BANC's Lead ""Independent"" Director, Chad Brownstein, has strong ties to Jason Galanis, his indicted associates, and COR Capital. Mr. Brownstein also accepted an undisclosed loan from Camden that is secured by his Los Angeles Mansion but appears to finance his outside business ventures.
We See Similarities Between BANC And Galanis' Gerova Financial fraud.

But BioPath is still missing the ball and will almost certainly continue to do so as this company attempts to produce a drug delivery platform.

Indeed, the new company presents these massive risks for investment portfolios:

* Reverse Merger; Inexperienced Management: The CEO/CFO/Treasurer/Chairman/President reverse merged a golf company to create a biotech. He is among the company's four leaders with virtually no experience in biotech. 

* Unfortunate Supporter: Recent support from Rodman & Renshaw and Maxim offer good reasons for investors to avoid BioPath.

* Uncertain Revenue Generation: Any possible product sales are distant dreams. The top drug candidate is only in Phase II trials. The second candidate is approaching Phase II. So the candidates must get through one to two more phases of study before even going after FDA approval to market the drug. 

* Fierce Competition: No one knows whether the drug candidates will succeed and some experts are skeptical. Meanwhile, many established companies are developing encouraging therapies for the very same target patients.

* Low Institutional Interest: Five institutions have sold out, including a particularly noteworthy investor.

* Stock Dilution Looms: BioPath's cash has fallen to an estimated $7.65 million. At a $1.25 million quarterly burn rate, it will take plenty of money to proceed with trials and business operations.

Burlington Stores (formerly Burlington Coat Factory) is an off-price discount retailer based in Burlington, NJ that sells mens and     womens clothing, home furnishings, and accessories. It competes with the likes of TJX Companies (T.J. Maxx, Marshalls), Ross     Stores, and countless other retailers offering shoppers a discount to the M.S.R.P.     ? In January 2006, Bain Capital privatized Burlington by acquiring control for $45.50 per share, valuing the company at $2.0 billion,     or 7x EBITDAR and 15.6x P/E according to the proxy     ? Under pressure from a series of struggling retail investments (e.g. Toys RUs, Guitar Center), Bain Capital seized the opportunity     to re-IPO Burlington in 2013. Its IPO prospectus touted various growth opportunities to excite new investors including: a) Improve     merchandising, b) improve the shopping experience for its mostly female customer base, c) refresh existing stores and grow to     1,000 locations, and e) invest in technology + supply chain initiatives to inc. inventory turnover, and improve operating leverage     ? With its share price up 330% since its IPO, Burlington has benefited both from low income shoppers searching for deals, and     managements aggressive financial and accounting tactics to engineer beat and raise quarters. However, in the brutally     competitive retail business fortunes can change fast, and we believe investors are under-appreciating risks being signaled     Burlington Has Been Touting impressive Comparable Store Sales (CSS), Gross Margin, and EPS Gains, While Shrinking     Same Store Inventory. We Dont Think It Can Last. Spruce Point Has Identified Numerous Financial Presentation,     Accounting, And Business Issues That Could Be Signaling A Slowdown In Future Financial Results     ? At IPO, Burlington touted the advantages of its large stores (80k sqft). Now, the story keeps changing; it repeatedly talked down     its optimal store size format (50-60k, now 40-50k).

Bleecker Street said that Honig had a consistent and visible history of running abject stock promotions that eventually imploded, and it said that the FBI and SEC appeared to be closing in on Honig for fraud and stock promotion. Bleecker Street also noted ""blatant operational/financial shenanigans"" at Chromadex, and it said that the company's supposed profitability appeared to be engineered and was likely fake.

Later that day, Chromadex said that the report was ""laden with misinformation, innuendo and the use of selective historical information,"" and the company said that it was exploring its options in response.

On 6-24-2016, the company announced that a director had resigned, citing the Bleecker Street report. Chromadex also said that the company's recent profitability was not the result of a ""related party transaction"" but that an increase in its ingredients sales had driven an increase in revenue. The company said that HealthSpan, a company that a Chromadex board member founded and managed, was not a distributor of Chromadex's products but was instead a customer of its ingredients, and it said that the company's payments to SmallCap Network all took place between 2011 and 2012.",n/a,Accounting Fraud,stock promotion;possible fraud;accounting fraud;accounting misrepresentation,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Chromadex Corporation,Nasdaq,fy2016,1,,ChromaDex Corporation,IQ5034211,Life Sciences Tools and Services,NasdaqCM:CDXC,1.64243,21.66465,-2.92819,0,11.27411,0.41956,1.64243,11.27411,0,5.85203,10.39053,1.19378,5.85203,10.67298,0,7.91263,2.52277,-4.11456,15.73694,0,0.24085,3.09517,0,-0.24567,1.77817,-2.80521,0.11701,0.02032,-0.33329,0,0.48623,-3.1385,0,19.75207,-0.4131,-2.9366,5.97829,-3.5516,-1.50492,0,0,0,0,-3.5516,0,0.25546,0.62341,0,8.86915,0,-0.22,0,-2.92819,0,0.34359,0,-1.72492,0,0,0,9.77771,-2.92819,0,0,-3.5516,0,0.03755,-0.07852,0,-45.22357,-0.09523,-5.22188,0,37.29432,-5.22188,9.97436,-0.07852,6.43409,9.97436,-0.09523,0,19.75207,37.29432,0,-0.0526,0,-0.0526,43174,42735,-2.38565,0,37.90453,-2.38565,0.75428,37.90453,-3.90724,(Invalid Formula 0me),-2.80521,0.26314,-1.77965,9.48813,0.606,0.26174,0.25032,-1.96156,0,0.59905,0,-5.22188,0.25546,0,-4.39436,0.34359,0,-4.18606,-1.04338,0.048,2.32122,10.57341,0,-3.89057,84,0,822

completely harebrained scheme to pump water from a desert aquifer underneath a national monument to
communities in Southern California. The project has been blocked at multiple levels of government due to
environmental concerns, but after nearly two decades of lobbying, the proponents have achieved a few partial
legal victories. That has prompted investor optimism that the project will come to fruition despite continuing
roadblocks. Most recently, CDZI managed to insert a rider into an appropriations bill that would reverse an
agency decision against the project, but the language is staunchly opposed by Senator Diane Feinstein and is
highly unlikely to become law. Congressional schedules make it probable that the bill will not even be
considered during the current session, and CDZI faces another liquidity crunch in 2017. When CDZI ran out
of cash early this year, I misjudged the willingness of its financial backers to continue pursuing the project
without wiping out equity holders. They may not be so charitable next time. CDZI currently trades 30%

And that run-on     sentence is just the beginning      Sell-     side promotions and hope     -      based investments are often built on the foundation of a     strategic business model pivot.

As a result, accounting warts, irreconcilable financial results, andoperating inconsistencies that would traditionally cause severe stock price declines, can be     marginalized and ignored at least until the story is busted.

Muddy Waters also published a list of 10 questions that it said Casino should answer on its 1-14-2016 call, and it said that many of the questions were about whether there was truly a recovery in Casino's France retail business beyond management's bullish EBITDA guidance and recent small market share gains. Muddy Waters also said that S&Ps leverage calculations contained material arithmetic errors, and it added that Casino was using property sale gains to cover up the fact that its discounting strategy had not generated much of an increase in profitability. Muddy Waters reiterated its price target of approximately 7 per share.","The basic problem with Casino is that its financial statements are literally meaningless to  understanding the companys (poor) health.

Friendly Bear said that the company's decision to settle a dispute with its competitor, Steelhouse, over fraudulent clicks, showed that Criteo potentially had been avoiding revelations regarding its business practices in the discovery phase of a trial. Friendly Bear said that Steelhouse, in its lawsuit, claimed that approximately 25% of Criteo's projected revenues had been from fraudulent clicks and that 50% of Criteo's clicks had no original source, 6x greater than the industry average, which suggested potential ""bot"" traffic.

On 12-5-2016, Criteo responded to The Friendly Bear's report and said that the allegations contained in the post were ""utterly baseless and include[d] a number of unsubstantiated and false statements about Criteo's business model and operations.""","We analyzed metacode relating to Criteo and found massive red flags including Criteos undisclosed relationship with a notorious adware company and Criteos ads on numerous shady websites with suspicious traffic.

We join a chorus of skeptics, including vocal Criteo critic and Harvard Business School Professor Benjamin Edelman, who have publicly questioned the veracity of Criteos return on ad spend"" metrics.

Our analysis raises real questions about Criteo's metrics  i.e., placing ad on a shady website that derives traffic from porn, inconceivable margin profile, nefarious adware injections, etc.

Criteos decision to settle with Steelhouse (represented by Latham & Watkins) prior to discovery is particularly worrisome because Criteo initiated the action and our analysis appears to corroborate Steelhouses claims.

We believe advertisers are potentially wasting vast sums of money on Criteo and could pull back spend with limited sales impact, potentially invalidating Criteo's entire business model, or 'raison d'être'.",Other information,product not as valuable as perceived,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Criteo S.A. ,Nasdaq,fy2016,1,,Criteo S.A.,IQ111853347,Advertising,NasdaqGS:CRTO,270.317,1799.146,82.272,0,1154.171,56.779,270.317,1154.171,0,397.244,644.975,43.259,456.19,409.293,0,0,111.672,-117.97,742.584,0,0,215.892,0,81.862,108.581,124.01,0,17.029,0.218,0,312.362,123.464,0,1211.186,-3.006,153.469,365.788,120.458,-85.133,0,33.129,0,7.969,87.329,-235.541,0,0,0,519.791,0,0,77.611,82.272,0.159,0,0,-312.763,9.745,-2.921,0,601.309,82.272,84.022,0,82.272,84.022,2.093,1.29894,0,198.355,1.29894,-12.227,0,63.33779,-12.227,600.132,1.25,20.075,609.877,1.25,0,1211.186,65.63347,0,1.13847,0,1.09865,43525,42735,180.789,0,63.9782,180.789,90.57,63.99,-83.22,(Invalid Formula 0me),124.01,9.38026,273.19,287.77,92.401,1.3,4.49794,72.108,43.522,85.58,0,71.795,7.969,27.5025,90.4505,77.611,0,91.15925,-184.737,2.404,1.252,695.457,43.153,95.656,2503,-10.024,833

DISH responded that the company was in an FCC-mandated quiet period and that it would continue to manage its business for ""the long-term benefit"" of shareholders.

Soon after, ValueWalk published excerpts from a report that Kerrisdale was preparing, as well as an hour-long video. In the report, Kerrisdale questioned DISH's strategic direction and the value of its ""massive"" portfolio of spectrum licenses, and Kerrisdale added that DISH was ""levering up a slowly decaying business to double and triple down on an illiquid, highly specialized, highly regulated, limited-life, non-cash-flowing asset with only two to three plausible buyers."" Kerrisdale also said that an imminent new spectrum auction would drastically reduce benchmark price expectations, and it said that DISH's overpriced inventory lacked interested customers. Kerrisdale additionally said that DISH's core pay-TV business faced declining subscribers, strengthened competitors and manifesting secular issues. (Later, ValueWalk redacted the links to Kerridale's video content.)

On 5-11-2016, Kerrisdale published its full, 33-page report on DISH. It said that the fair value of DISH's equity was 58% lower the current stock price, or $20.00, but it added that fair value could drop as low as $8.00 per share. Kerrisdale also announced the launch of its website discussing DISH's spectrum, www.makespectrumgreatagain.com. Kerrisdale's website said that it was unlikely DISH would build out its own network or sell its spectrum to AT&T or Verizon, and it said that DISH should cancel its licenses and give back the spectrum before its AWS-4 spectrum expired in 2020.

Later that day, Kerrisdale's Sahm Adrangi discussed DISH in an interview with CNBC.

On 5-20-2016, Kerrisdale published a 14-page follow-up report on DISH's suspected tax law violations. Kerrisdale said that DISH was benefiting from almost $1 billion of annual tax deductions by amortizing the cost of its wireless spectrum licenses, but Kerrisdale said that until DISH actually conducted a trade or business using its cellular spectrum, it had no legitimate grounds for benefiting from amortization. Kerrisdale said that it had reported its findings to the IRS.

On 6-13-2016, Kerrisdale announced that it would hold a conference call on 6-16-2016 to discuss DISH and some of the issues most frequently raised since it had published its report.","Carriers have plenty of spectrum already. DISH bulls generally buy into the notion that
spectrum is extraordinarily scarce and cellular data consumption is relentlessly skyrocketing.
However, even if these beliefs were true, it would not necessarily imply that spectrum prices
should be high and rising. After all, the revenue generated by using that spectrum to provide
wireless service grew relatively slowly for years, declined in 2014 for the first time ever,1 and
declined again in 2015.2 Fierce competition has kept a lid on what users pay, while better
devices have increased the scope of the demands they place on networks. Thus it might take
twice as much spectrum to satisfy a $60-per-month customer today as it did a few years ago 
implying that that the profitability of a fixed unit of spectrum is falling, not rising. It takes more
input to produce the same economic output, so the input is worth less.
Moreover, the scarcity of spectrum is vastly overstated. Consider, for instance, Verizon  the
largest carrier in the US and the most frequently rumored counterparty for DISH. As of the first
quarter of 2016, the vast majority of Verizons data traffic (92%3
) ran over its LTE network. But
though Verizon holds, on average, 114 MHz of spectrum nationwide, its LTE network uses only half that.",Overvalued by markets,legal headwinds;contract not as valauble as perceived;customer retention issues,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,Dish Network Corporation,Nasdaq,fy2016,1,,DISH Network Corporation,IQ110001,Cable and Satellite,NasdaqGS:DISH,5324.503,15212.302,1497.939,35.616,9901.752,931.202,5360.119,9901.752,0,777.908,5310.55,13.037,777.908,2048.939,0,422.349,0,109.364,8280.387,921.202,-43.157,6396.483,0,33.976,2654.271,2340.409,-98.019,33.248,-21.973,-144.212,16531.459,2318.659,0,27914.292,97.944,2854.247,524.704,2416.603,-614.055,0,865.818,0,941.903,1550.785,0,0,0,0,4592.832,0,-2224.329,15541.736,1497.939,523.582,0,0,-1737.07,317.408,0,0,22983.335,1497.939,5000,0,1497.939,5000,4.652,3.22271,0,1536.691,3.22271,-1543.521,0,464.807,-1543.521,4613.549,3.15071,18.625,4930.957,3.15071,0,27914.292,484.162,0,3.00408,0,2.88398,43509,42735,3271.611,0,0,3274.119,3153.93,465.35369,4271.107,(Invalid Formula 0me),2340.409,9.91633,3680.611,-11917.91,409,0,-25.61628,1396.31588,439.57,16483.639,0,3456.479,941.903,35.8278,-1430.7075,15541.736,0,-1397.49438,11123.52,0,966.105,21414.596,359.01,2657.556,16000,506.808,839

sector. Founded by the same people behind Groupon, Echo has yet to be fully exposed until now. Led by Eric
Lefkofsky and his partner Brad Keywell, these inter-related, yet distinct publicly traded businesses share the same
founders, business address, auditors, and same modus operandi of hyping proprietary and disruptive
technologies capable of earning massive profits in large, fragmented markets. In our opinion, time and results have
shown these predictions have failed to live up to initial expectations, and have lead to large shareholder losses to
post IPO investors, but enriched its founders and early backers who quickly dumped stockDubious Technology Claims and Fundamental Struggles: It is a wild stretch to believe Echo is anything more than atransportation broker with limited technology advantages. Much like Groupon, which hyped its technology, Echo
often claims its proprietary technology advantage. When it came public, Echo hyped its ETM technology, but hassince stopped discussing it, as well as its enterprise client base and shipping volumes, which Echo initially touted
offered it revenue stability from contractual arrangements. Echo has shuffled through five Chief Technology Officers,and employee reviews reflect its technology dept is in disarray. Its last technology iteration  Optimizer is not even
optimized for Google Chrome, the worlds most popular browser! Even worse, Echo is now being challenged by a wave of new start-ups trying to Uberize the trucking industry with real-time, location-based technologies. Echos
previous foray into mobile app development appears to have failed miserably. The ubertization movement of the industry has the potential to seize market share, and force margin compression among traditional players such as
Echo. Adding insult to injury, New Enterprise Associates, Echos early venture backer, is now directly investing in Transfix, a disruptive competitor.... Diverging Alignment of Insiders With Investors: Echos pre-IPO backers and founders have largely cashed out. The
current CEO/CFO owns a paltry 2% of the stock. However, more worrisome, management keeps gearing its compensation more towards cash (less toward stock) every single year. Option grants, a highly levered bet on the
upside of Echos stock, are non-existent in recent years. Options are critically important motivators for attracting
technology talent, which appears absent at Echo. Echos compensation peer set was recently re-constituted to, notsurprisingly,
position itself among larger technology companies to justify greater cash pay to management.... 
Questionable Benefits From Echos Acquisition Strategy: As a subscale player in the transportation logistics sector,
which has limited barriers to entry, Echo has grown primarily through acquisitions and completed 21 deals since 2007.
As noted by peers and industry experts, sector M&A is particularly challenging given various cultural and technological
system integrations necessary. Spruce Point has a strong history of evaluating flawed acquisition strategies (notably
Ametek), and believes that Echos strategy has created limited/no operating leverage. Key to evaluating its strategy, we
observe that in over a decade Echo has not demonstrated it can generate any excess cash flow. Since 2006, its cash

The roll-up EFIs continued use of acquisitions concurrent with plummeting free-cash-flow is a long-term recipe for disaster: While the company touts its double-digit top-line growth, based on free-cash-flow trends (or lack thereof, at $52.6 million TTM) and no organic growth, we believe the firm will run into cash flow issues and generate future diminishing returns in upcoming periods.  Accounting irregularities litter EFIs weak balance sheet and add a time catalyst to EFIs share-price demise: Inventory diagnostics provide evidence of channel stuffing at EFI with inventories up near 50% YOY, dwarfing revenue growth. Management misclassifies long-term receivables into other assets on the balance sheet and misleadingly excludes them from their reported DSO calculation.  In our view, EFI has underfunded its warranty reserve liability, especially in light of its recently disclosed extended warranty terms. We calculate this under-expense  Sell-side analysts are fooled by phony non-GAAP exclusions that GHR will expose as neither non-recurring nor non-cash expenses: EFI is the benefactor from one of the worst uses of non-GAAP exclusions GHR has seen in our long-tenured history. TTM non-GAAP income ($2.22) now stands 290% above GAAP income of $0.57, representing the highest difference in EFIs history. Persistent material exclusions of intangible amortization expenses, stock-based compensation, restructuring/other and acquisition-related costs obfuscate EFIs sustainable earnings. EFI uses highly questionable judgement with its executives in key positions: With an auditing board member with ties to Tyco, a recently appointed CFO who nearly ran his previous business into bankruptcy, subjective short-term bonus incentives for the CEO & CFO, and no CPAs anywhere in sight in key executive positions, GHR believes management is creating a culture of hitting the numbers at EFI. Premium valuation erroneously based on adjusted earnings is unwarranted given the material long-term structural issues and near-term accounting risk: Using a sustainable earnings figure detailed in this report, GHR will show why we believe an approximate 71.0% downside to EFIs current share price is in its future",Accounting Fraud,accounting misrepresentation;corporate governance problems;organic growth overstated,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Electronics for Imaging, Inc.",Nasdaq,fy2016,1,,"Electronics for Imaging, Inc.",IQ27970,"Technology Hardware, Storage and Peripherals",NasdaqGS:EFII,164.313,992.065,44.949,295.428,483.9,53.481,459.741,483.9,1.6,220.813,508.165,31.726,221.788,246.694,0,96.338,151.395,-31.221,813.529,0,4.51,173.219,37.96,0.651,103.474,72.116,0,0,-13.771,-2.429,482.838,54.545,0,1478.929,-15.897,121.004,114.287,38.648,-22.373,0.098,-6.301,0,0,44.949,-19.932,0,0,0,263.861,0,0,318.636,44.949,36.507,0,0,-10.908,0,-6.731,0,652.914,44.949,0,0,44.949,0,0.53,0.9584,-0.528,417.889,0.9584,-8.275,-273.73,46.9,-8.803,826.015,0.94,11.1,826.015,0.94,-83.292,1478.929,47.797,0,0.72688,0,0.71324,43523,42735,125.597,0,46.581,125.597,-109.106,46.43186,1.364,(Invalid Formula 0me),72.116,17.73287,137.197,343.177,11.6,2.975,7.36732,34.09063,6.812,318.734,0,-8.803,0.098,NM,100.698,318.636,0,111.7705,-141.007,16.338,-3.764,1144.749,4.79,103.224,3235,-11.091,843

The Street Sweeper said that the company's sales had dropped by 82% as the company's partners switched to its rivals, and that the company had a consistently negative cash flow. The Street Sweeper warned that the company faced potential dilution after the company reduced the price of warrants and preferred shares, and that its high cash burn indicated the company would need to dilute the stock more to raise cash through equity offerings.","Ekso is a little like legendary bad singer Florence Foster Jenkins ... all off-key with the braying stock promotions, plus cheap warrants, insatiable cash needs, looming potential stock dilution, paltry institutional interest, high executive compensation, plunging sales, consistently negative earnings, massive operating losses and partners signing up with rivals. The involvement of an admitted stock manipulator/exuberant baritone/investment banker adds yet another layer to the enormous hazards offered by Ekso.

Glaucus said the company had inexplicable operating margins and used suspicious off-balance sheet entities. Glaucus said that the company obfuscated its ownership and financial performance and went to lengths to prevent scrutiny. Glaucus cited the breakdown of an acquisition by Asahi because the company protected against due diligence. Glaucus accused the company of falsifying documents and fudging facts on a number of occasions. Glaucus also pointed to a former attorney that worked with the company who had alleged the CEO had admitted to earnings manipulation and fraud in a 2012 lawsuit.

Later that day, National Beverage said that Glaucus' report was ""false and defamatory."" The company said that the allegations were based on allegations made in a complaint ""for the purpose of extorting money from the company,"" which National Beverage said was dismissed as being without foundation.

On 9-29-2016, the company issued a second statement in response to Glaucus, saying that Glaucus' report contained information that was adjudicated and found to be without merit both at the trial court and on appeal, which National Beverage said was in violation of a protective order, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements. The company also announced the launch of a website at www.readthetruefacts.com, which included multiple court documents that it said were in response to Glaucus, including information from National Beverage's litigation counsel, Waldman Trigoboff Hildebrandt Marx & Calnan. Waldman said that National Beverage intended ""to vigorously enforce its legal rights in respect of this matter and to pursue any parties and co-conspirators responsible for the violation of the Companys enforceable agreements, Court Orders and for the commercial defamation of the Company.""
","Alleged CEO Admission of Earnings Manipulation and Fraud in Federal Court Deposition and Complaint: Recently un-redacted complaint by a former attorney for FIZZs CEO and Chairman Nick Caporella alleged that Caporella admitted to manipulating FIZZs earnings using a little jewel box and by directing his son to create fake invoices. Attempted Take-Private Killed By Refusing Asahi Access to Due Diligence: Records produced in a 2014 litigation indicate that Caporella refused to allow a potential acquirer to perform adequate due diligence on the Company, which appears to be a contributing factor in the failure of the deal. According to letters written by Caporella, counsel for the potential acquirer either stated or implied that Caporellas fear of due diligence indicated that he was hiding something at FIZZ.  Ludicrous Corporate Governance Structure: FIZZs CEO and CFO are not paid or directly employed by FIZZ. Rather, they are compensated by a privately held company, Corporate Management Advisors, (CMA) owned by the CEO. In exchange for 1% of FIZZs revenue, CMA oversees FIZZs legal, audit and financial operations. Shareholders have no visibility into CMA, creating a structure ripe for fraud. Alleged Undisclosed Related Party: A complaint brought by FIZZs former marketing director for one of its premier brands alleges that he was instructed to set up a corporate entity in order to be paid as an independent contractor. The Company denies he was an employee, even though he had business cards, full access to the facility and a corporate email address. Alleged Undisclosed Related Party Distributor: A plaintiff alleged that a FIZZ employee was physically present at, operated, directed and managed an independent distributor not listed as a subsidiary or related party in any of the Companys filings, raising the specter that such entities are used to hide costs or, per insider allegations, create fake invoices to boost sales. This is reminiscent of Valeant and Philidor. Undisclosed Stock Gift: Testimony from a 2014 deposition indicates that an employee received a stock gift of 150,000 shares (and a cash payment to cover the attendant taxes) from FIZZs CEO and majority shareholder even though such a stock transfer was never reflected in the Companys SEC filings. Falsifying Documents: Former Company counsel (and convicted criminal) Scott Rothstein testified that he and former FIZZ general counsel fudged facts on behalf of FIZZ in a previous litigation.

In the letter, MHA said that its original conclusion reported in January 2016, which it said identified an improvement in oil productivity in wells which used the CnF additive within Focus Areas 1 and 2, was still valid. MHA said that the inclusion of FDP-S1007-11 as a CnF additive, which it said was not included in its original analyses, did not change its conclusion.

On 12-27-2016, FourWorld published a letter in response to Flotek. It said that the company's response was ""underwhelming,"" and it detailed four things the company could do to resolve FourWorld's doubts. FourWorld added that MHA had acknowledged that a substantial part of the sample was misclassified, showed that this reduced the estimated uplift from CnF use by 80% in focus area 1 and acknowledged that operator best practices, later length, and location all affected well productivity. It said that Flotek had acknowledged its criticisms but had done nothing to address them. ",Other information,natural resource value overstated,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Flotek Industries, Inc.

Vranic suggested there was nothing stopping the underwriters from shorting the stock to the low $90's.

On 9-15-2016, Vranic said that the company had refused to comment on the buyout rumor, and he noted that the company's chief medical officer sold ADSs after exercising options on 9-14-2016 after the rumor.

Davis added that GW Pharmaceuticals had overestimated the typical cost and underestimated the unique appeal of ""whole-plant"" cannabis oils versus a standardized prescription medication, and she said that many families said they would not use Epidiolex, even if provided for free. Davis also said that GW Pharmaceuticals had yet to prove that the treatment even worked more often than not.
","Purportedly operating in the same sector as MJNA, GW Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:GWPH) appears massively over-valued and presents a clear and present risk to long investors.

Marijuana Hype Overplayed: GW Pharmaceuticals will derive no benefit from the nascent retail marijuana market opportunity in Colorado, Washington, and other legalizing states.
Corrupted Research: The purported ""research literature"" regarding marijuana plant-derived cannabidiol (CBD) use in pediatric treatment-resistant epilepsy seems especially dubious because GW Pharmaceuticals has corrupted the objectivity of the authors by being their financial backers; it has failed to disclose this critical fact in SEC filings or investor materials.
Limited Intellectual Property & Pricing Power: Because GW Pharmaceuticals' main products are natural plant-derived extracts, they cannot be patented and there are basically no barriers to other firms extracting and selling the same biologicals. For example, just because orange juice is demonstrated to provide a health benefit doesn't mean that a company can earn outsized returns by selling concentrated Vitamin C.
Ridiculous Market Valuation: As of yesterday's close of $57.44/ADS, GW Pharmaceuticals is currently trading at a market capitalization of $1,098.5m, for a shocking valuation of 19.6x LTM revenue and 18.5x P/B despite barely being break-even on an operating cash flow basis since its reverse-merger formation in 2001.
Backdoor Listing onto NASDAQ: After completing a reverse-merger listing in 2001 to the London AIM exchange (equivalent to U.S. OTC market listing), GW Pharmaceuticals listed its American Depository Shares (ADS) on the NASDAQ on 05/01/13 as an ""emerging growth company"" under the relaxed regulatory requirements of the JOBS Act at only $8.90/ADS.
Massive Shareholder Dilution: GW Pharmaceuticals has been a serial issuer of equity, massively diluting its common shareholders since its listing without significant technological advancement or technology monetization. For example, GW Pharmaceuticals sold a 5.8% stake in the Company for $11.2mm in 2009 ($193mm implied enterprise valuation) to a private equity firm with a history of backing some rather dubious biotech offerings.
Egregious Insider Compensation: Annual management compensation has generally exceeded annual operating income since the reverse-merger formation in 2001. Moreover, while public shareholders have been significantly diluted over GW Pharmaceuticals' history as a public company, management and insider compensation has increased 205.9%.
Preposterous Sell-Side Analyst Cheerleading: Underwriters of GW Pharmaceuticals' numerous equity market issuances have been relentless cheerleaders of the ""story"" since the single digit listing of the ADS last summer. As the ADS price has rocketed up 545% over the last 9 months since listing on the NASDAQ, the sell-side analysts have continually raised their price targets as prior estimates were blown through and utilized ""goal-seek"" financial models to justify their current estimates. Utilizing more realistic valuation assumptions, GW Pharmaceuticals' intrinsic value appears to be in the teens per ADS even in the unlikely upside case the proposed Epidiolex epilepsy treatment is a blockbusters success.",Product ineffective,public hype;dumb money;product not as valuable as perceived,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,GW Pharmaceuticals,Nasdaq,fy2016,1,,GW Pharmaceuticals plc,IQ6136592,Pharmaceuticals,NasdaqGM:GWPH,487.5118,12.73,-91.696,0,3.82,5.152,487.5118,3.82,0,1.01307,8.91,12.661,30.2631,33.188,0,5.5315,104.375,-0.735,526.74015,0,0.656,64.46648,0,-0.403,50.71455,-128.653,0,0,0.367,0.432,7.60321,-92.389,0,590.10111,0,-119.928,4.47026,-92.389,-12.192,0,-0.693,0,1.10031,-91.696,0,0.27475,0,0,45.50989,0,-0.719,10.86247,-91.696,0,6.45733,0,-12.911,0,0,0,71.21028,-91.696,0,0,-91.696,0,0.39325,-4.04296,0,-231.55613,-4.04296,-0.515,0,22.68042,-0.515,518.89084,-4.04296,274.776,518.89084,-4.04296,0,590.10111,22.68042,0,-2.54595,0,-2.54595,43524,42643,-123.501,0,25.17167,-123.501,274.261,25.17167,128.154,(Invalid Formula 0me),-128.653,20.61408,-120.201,511.28762,3.3,0.097,20.31202,-57.74313,1.241,18.69486,0,-0.515,1.37506,NM,-79.91793,17.3198,0,-79.76543,-468.81694,0,4.25931,537.5857,1.65,-135.693,496,-2.343,861

She said that the company had perfectly timed its IPO following a sudden influx of temporary traffic, but Davis said traffic had begun to decline at its established restaurants. Davis also said that Habit could face customer backlash for its menu price boots, and she added that the company faced high personnel expenses, in addition to a recent hike in the California minimum wage. Davis additionally said that Habit's plan to open new restaurants on the East Coast would be less productive than its established locations because it lacked the brand awareness, the economies of scale and the experienced labor pool of its California market.","If history continues to repeat itself, The Habit Restaurants will leave even recent investors wishing that they had never swallowed the hamburger chain's juicy growth story.

Currently trading at close to 70 times its prior-year earnings, HABT owes much of its lofty valuation to overblown hopes for its future growth prospects.

With traffic actually declining at its established restaurants, the company has started to rely on higher prices and longer hours for all of its same-store growth.

Lakewood additionally said that while consumers were familiar with several of Hormel's popular brands, two-thirds of the company's profits came from its low margin commodity pork processing and turkey farming businesses, which it said would face secular pressures, and Lakewood also said that per capita pork and turkey consumption had peaked. On 5-25-2016, Hormel announced that its CFO would retire effective 10-30-2016. Hormel also said that it had appointed its vice president and chief accounting officer to be the company's new CFO.

Street Sweeper said that new regulations leaked to the media suggested that Chinese companies would no longer be able to acquire a company for $1 billion or more outside of their own core business and that Ingram was not part of Tianjin's core business. Street Sweeper said it appeared that most sell-side analysts assumed the buy-out would go through due to a lack of knowledge of the new restrictions.

On 12-6-2016, Ingram Micro announced that, on 12-5-2016, Tianjin Tianhai Investment completed its acquisition of the company for $38.90 per share.","The Street Sweeper issues an investor alert for Ingram Micro (IM).
Leaked Chinese government documents indicate the $6 billion acquisition of Ingram could be in trouble.  In February, Ingram Micro announced China-based Tianjin Tianhai Investment would pay $38.90 per share cash to acquire Ingram.  But now a China-based company will not be allowed to acquire a company for $1 billion or more that is not within their core business, suggest new Chinese regulations leaked to the Chinese media.  Under the buyout deal, Ingram Micro would become a subsidiary of China-based HNA Group specializing in logistics, aviation, financial services and tourism. HNA is a major shareholder of Tianjin Tianhai, which focuses on shipping, logistics and financing. California-based Ingram Micro would be outside the Chinese companies' core business because it is an information technology company.
Below is a partial copy of the photographed document said to be from the People's Bank of China conference record, indicating the central government likely has already passed the regulation on to the bank. It's not perfectly clear whether the restrictions would institute an actual ban or more intensive scrutiny, but the economic issues demand that China reduce its capital outflow:

Land & Buildings had previously engaged in multiple shareholder activism campaigns, but this was its first activist short-selling campaign. L&B said IRET's dividend should be cut in half, as IRET had excessive leverage and earnings estimates were too high. L&B said fundamentals were deteriorating at North Dakota-based IRET and that comparable apartment REITs traded at deep discounts.

Later that day, Reuters reported that IRET said in an emailed statement that it ""disagrees with the analysis in the presentation.""

On 6-6-2016, IRET said it would sell all Healthcare and Industrial properties, focusing on multifamily properties instead, which made up 63% of its portfolio.

On 8-31-2016, the company announced that it had entered into six separate sales agreements for the planned disposition of 26 of the company's senior housing properties and one multifamily property for a total of approximately $236 million, which IRET said would complete its exit from its senior housing portfolio.

On 9-29-2016, Land & Buildings issued a press release, saying that IRET's shares still had further 30% downside to fair value. Land & Buildings said that the company's earnings guidance would be reduced, with a 10-15% guidance reduction to pro forma likely in the next 90 days, and it said that IRET's core multifamily business had suffered sharply lower same store growth results due to excess supply and meager demand.

nemesis for short sellers. The company has spun a high-tech story of cloud
computing, digital media, and mergers and acquisitions. All the while, it is being
funded by its legacy eFax business.
That is the story they want you to hear.
The real story, exposed here for the first time, is a company spending a billion on
a roll-up strategy with negative organic growth. J2 has been buying money-losing
commoditized cloud computing companies, combining them with a nonperforming
digital media strategy to inflate its top line, as EBIDTA runs in place.
Why Has The Bull Case on eFax Finally Come to an End?
In this report, Citron will show in new disclosures contained in j2 Globals 10-K,
that the companys core business has hit a wall. More importantly, the barrier to
entry of their cash cow eFax business is gone as it finally comes off patent
protection. This is the beginning of the endgame after the company spent years
rolling up a near monopoly control of an industry in decline.

? Gross merchandise volume (GMV) is a misleading metric due to its very definition. We would discount it by 35-50%.

Using GMV is inappropriate, especially for loss-making companies like JD.com consistently raising capital.

? Incoherent investments in 24 months have led to $1bn impairments. JD CFO on the Bitauto Board from 2010. JD took

a 25% stake and since then, Bitauto stock lost ~70%. Bitauto stock down -13% and -9% in 2 days after Q1 2016 results.

? The assumption that JDs model will produce adequate profits to justify $30bn price tag is questionable. Core

electronics/household business (>74% of revenues) is unlikely to make relevant money even if scale doubles due to

intense competition. Growing GMV of these businesses do not make sense as cash will have to be burnt.

? Chinas big three internet companies, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent (BAT) make significant profits from core business

and can afford to burn cash in new businesses. We believe JD.com does not have that same luxury.

? Not a surprise that JD raised ~$2bn in last 5 months to finance unprofitable businesses. Fitch2 comments JD may have

a high yield credit profile, while Moodys/S&P gave it the lowest investment grade rating at Baa3/BBB-. As soon as

banks and investors stop funding JD, its operations may be weaker which is a risk investors must be mindful of.

? Limited tenure of management of ~3 years for a 12+year old company. This pales in comparison with other companies

and does not square with the claim that it is the leading online company in China.

? Reported net selling by insiders (Fortune Rising) and outside large shareholders over the last 12 months.

? JD has been touted as the Amazon of China but it is not comparable for reasons delineated in this report. Amazon does

not obsess about metrics like GMV, unlike JD  a telling sign

? Except for one analyst, nearly 30 sell-side analysts have a buy rating on the stock which can mean that the stock is

over-owned as reported also by the media.

Yet the stock turned upward as Kemet reported a quarterly earnings miss and $183 million revenue down 5% year over year; as well as settlement of one of these investigations.

*First, filings show lawsuits, verdicts and investigations - for March 2015-March 2016 alone - cost Kemet about 6.1 billion yen or $58 million. 

*Second, price-fixing probes are not over yet. The company and subsidiaries are defendants in multiple ongoing global investigations into price fixing and bid rigging conspiracies by capacitor manufacturers.

The Hanover, Maryland-based company hasn't responded to TheStreetSweeper's request for comment but investors may find various viewpoints here. Meanwhile, we present the top five reasons KEYW faces big troubles.

*1. KEYW Must Dump Embarrassing Loser

The company had plodded along as a boring government contractor until it captured investors' attention by forming the Hexis Cyber Solutions product line from two rollups and beginning to remake itself into a cyber security company.

Investors bought into KEYW's expectations for Hexis. They were under the impression that the new business was brimming with hope, based on the company's revenue projections:



(Source: Company SEC filing)

But Hexis has fallen far short of those expectations. The segment generated $7 million revenue less than anticipated in 2014. And the expected $40 million contribution to revenue in 2015 turned out to be under $14 million:",Overvalued by markets,Too many acquisitions;regulatory headwinds;strategy issues;organic growth overstated;customer retention issues,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,KEYW Holding Corporation,Nasdaq,fy2016,1,,The KeyW Holding Corporation,IQ51738175,Aerospace and Defense,NasdaqGS:KEYW,41.871,288.027,-25.728,0,196.772,12.416,41.871,196.772,0,43.141,91.255,3.472,43.459,71.434,11.563,15.178,0,15.516,104.858,0,-0.663,70.045,6.113,-4.694,40.615,13.708,0,0,-10.812,-0.016,298.581,1.322,0,445.453,3,23.095,6.913,4.322,-18.41,0,2.457,0,0,1.865,-2.504,0,-27.593,16.226,36.921,0,0,132.482,-25.728,0,0,0,-4.688,0,0,0,212.517,-25.728,0,0,1.865,0,0.041,-0.63524,0,-100.988,0.04605,0,0,40.501,0,232.936,-0.63524,2.237,232.936,0.04605,0,445.453,41.012,0,0.0204,0,0.02015,43175,42735,26.124,0,40.33062,26.124,2.237,40.33062,20.644,(Invalid Formula 0me),13.708,5.77566,33.824,-65.645,7.7,3.883,-1.62767,0.82625,0.04,132.482,0,0,0,56.8486,15.433,132.482,0,21.8505,90.611,10.3,-15.658,365.418,0.001,7.714,1058,2.456,877

After the fraud boom, the article explains that Nasdaq enhanced its due diligence practices to scrutinize listings:     ""Once Nasdaq noticed that many of these reverse merger companies shared promoters, directors, audit firms, and other professional services firms, we started analyzing the network""     That is why we were surprised to learn that Kingold Jewelry (NASDAQ:KGJI), a Chinese reverse merger that has awarded hundreds of thousands of shares to dubious stock promoters, continues to have a NASDAQ listing.

Before deciding to send additional millions overseas, we believe that U.S. investors deserve to have the facts. As part of our due-diligence, we obtained thousands of pages of Chinese-filed documents related to Kingold and its undisclosed affiliates.     Our research has uncovered a typical mix of Chinese reverse-merger characteristics: business claims that defy logic, fabricated SEC filings, false company statements, and undisclosed related party transactions.

Bloomberg reported this incident and listed those five companies names. They are: Gemsea Coach, Chery Wanda Bus, Shenzhen Wuzhoulong Motors Group, Higer Bus Co. and Shaolin Bus. Serious fines are going to likely be coming for these companies. For example, Gemsea Coach may be cancelled for national subsidy eligibility, and all of the produced EVs in 2015 may not be subsidized, potentially clawing back the entire national subsidy already paid to the company in 2015. For the other 4 companies, the government may claw back the national subsidy received for the 2,416 EVs they sold and may issues fines.

Meanwhile, let's throw some light on LightPath before this stock can burn investors.

*Heavily pushed by professional stock promoters

Stock promoters orchestrated a blitz promoting LightPath some 34 times, ultimately priming the stock most recently on June 2, 2015, June 3, 2015 and June 9, 2015. And in June 2013, another company pushed LightPath, along with CLSN (~$7.50 then, ~$1.40 now) and SONS (~$16 then, ~$5.90 now).

Heres a snapshot of some of the latest promos:

 



(Source: stockpromoters.com)

LightPath message boards have become the stomping ground of penny stock promoters, as indicated below:



(Source: Yahoo Finance)

Such promotions present a red flag for LightPath investors. All too often, investors get caught up in pump-and-dump schemes in which the stock rises for no real reason other than viral pumps, then the perpetrators dump the stock at inflated prices, leaving unsuspecting investors holding vastly devalued stock. Real companies, of course, dont want to be associated with pump-and-dumpers.

Additionally, solid companies with real products dont need hype spit out by professional stock promoters willing to educate potential investors, especially for a fee.

*Stock overheats

If we look past the promotions, LightPath metrics suggest the stock has been overheated to the boiling point and is now positioned to evaporate ... and the prospects are even more likely because of Lightpath's unusual cash position - which we will explain below.

First, let's consider that trailing price-to-earnings ratio over the past 12 months. It is an astronomic 67, while the price people are paying for future earnings is also staggering at 18.53.



We can see how out-priced it really is in many respects compared to the industry overall:



(Source: Yahoo Finance)

As if thats not enough, just one analyst covers the stock  and that analysts price target for the year is nearly a buck under todays price.

*Virtually no institutional interest

Big banks show a real lack of interest in LightPath. Investors can see in the snapshot below that institutional ownership is an incredibly tiny 6 percent:



 

(Source: Nasdaq.com)

And the institution holding the majority of shares -  2.7 million shares or close to 18 percent - is one most investors probably wouldnt recognize, Berg & Berg Enterprises  a creditor that court records suggest doesnt hesitate to push its weight around.

Legal filings allege that as a creditor, Berg & Berg tried to strong arm a struggling company into bankruptcy proceedings in order to capitalize on the company's $50 million in net operating losses.

*Fierce competitors

LightPath isnt even on the same wavelength as the well-heeled competitors in this space, including Panasonic (Panasonic (mat1.f), down 6.7% in past month), Kinik (down 5.4%, $4 billion revenue), Hoya Corporation, Samsung and Kyocera Corporation  as well as the industry overall.

*China ties force cash position to under $1 million

Companies' ties to China are of special concern particularly in the current climate - a climate well-known short-seller James Chanos of Kynikos Associates first recognized several years ago and ultimately turned into a pile of money.

LightPath is strongly linked to China. Though it states that customers tend to prefer doing business with US-based companies such as LightPath, the majority of its manufacturing appears to occur in none other than Zhenjiang, China and Shanghai, China.

While company presentations don't show a pathway toward growth, they do show the China facilities:



(Source: Company presentation)

Presentations also include a shot of the front door of corporate headquarters in Orlando, Florida and mention the manufacturing and office leased space there.

But public documents show nine other companies are also headquartered at the University of Central Florida Research Park, suggesting the 8,000 sq. ft. manufacturing floor may well be shared with others.



 

 

(Source: Bizapedia)

Indeed, LightPath is also intricately tied to China through the company's wholly-owned subsidiaries located in Jiading, People's Republic of China and in the New City district of the Jiangsu province of China.

In fact, LightPath director Xudong Zhu is also the President of Pudong Science and Technology Investment (Cayman) Co., Ltd. The entity holds about 14.9 percent of LightPath stock, including shares purchased for $1.40 per share in a January 2015 private placement that returned to LightPath about $1.3 million in desperately needed working capital and equipment.

Since the bulk of its business is tied up in China, so is half of its cash.

LightPath's cash and equivalents are technically $1.6 million. But, thanks to China's repatriation laws, LightPath needs nearly $10 million more in retained earnings before it can get its hands on the total amount.

So its cash coffers contain only about $800,000!

*Cash flow problems

As critical as cash is to running a company, it's no surprise that LightPath has cash flow issues. While it did make $663,000 in income last quarter, the problem is that it can't quickly turn sales into cash.

The company notes its ""DSO"" or days sales outstanding runs very high - about 63 days reported last quarter.

And it seems no end in sight with regard to its China customers particularly. So LightPath is throwing up another red flag as it tries to manage risk by roughly doubling its provision for doubtful accounts receivables to about $15.7 million.

*Misplaced priorities: R&D drops

R&D budget  the companys lifeblood - was low at $350,000 in 2014. Now the devotion of research and develop required to ultimately help find new customers is even lower.

Indeed, research and development last quarter fell to a paltry $148,000.

Yet selling, general and administrative costs are 10 times higher than R&D and have risen over time. Yes, incredibly, SG&A jumped from $1.3 million to $1.4 million.

Those SG&A costs are top-heavy, with the top three executives raking in over $1 million in compensation:



(Source: SEC filings)

Heres what these misplaced priorities really mean: With virtually no R&D, LightPath can expect little organic growth. The only remaining avenue for growth is through acquisition  So stock dilution appears a necessary evil.

*Conclusion

LightPath can't live up to its $50 million market valuation. It is tragically low on available cash, has accumulated losses of $205 million, and depends on financing activities to produce five times more cash than its business operations.

So, LightPath's cash and R&D budget continue to cool off while its stock overheats. If LightPath wants to keep the lights on, it appears a capital infusion is imminent - probably through a stock offering with looming dilution potential. 

All considered, TheStreetSweeper believes a fair valuation for LightPath would be 75 cents per share.",Overvalued by markets,Stock promotion;microcap scam;inappropriate valuation methods,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"LightPath Technologies, Inc.",Nasdaq,fy2016,1,,"LightPath Technologies, Inc.",IQ351646,Electrical parts,NasdaqCM:LPTH,2.90802,17.27224,1.41462,0,7.96773,0.84799,2.90802,7.96773,0,3.54587,9.30451,0.34874,3.75504,6.37222,0,3.83681,0.66884,-0.65075,11.15218,0,-0.9169,9.07336,0,0.72415,4.37005,2.26345,0,0,-0.03763,0,0,1.86793,0,15.58919,-0.25404,1.52571,1.36191,1.61389,-1.1311,0,0.19928,0.00592,0,1.41462,0,0.16645,0,0,3.21277,0,0,0,1.41462,0,0.17892,0,-1.12518,0,-0.209,0,4.65728,1.41462,0,0,1.41462,0,0.15591,0.09185,0,-204.01172,0.09185,-0.18293,0,15.40189,-0.18293,10.93191,0.08,0.42042,10.93191,0.08,0,15.58919,16.87538,0,0.0758,0,0.06918,42992,42551,3.11144,0,0,3.11144,0.23691,15.59095,1.2641,(Invalid Formula 0me),2.26345,0.70117,3.64078,10.93191,0.52934,0.03763,0.70117,1.16745,0.0043,0.34537,0,-0.18293,0.16645,12.3474,0.51088,0.17892,0,0.53439,-2.56265,0.03763,0.94819,11.27729,0.19928,1.98034,181,0,882

2015 organic revenue growth is ~1.5%, not 7.2% as reported. Organic growth well below industry averages.
MDCAs true Debt is understated by ~$300 million, or 23% of stated Debt as of 2015.
At least 42%-53% of reported profits are suspect.
7+ executive departures within recent quarters. At most 3 of Crispin Porter Bogurskys original 13 partners remain.

72andSunny was recently sued twice for copyright infringement. Crispin Porter Bogursky was similarly sued several years ago before CP+Bs fell from grace.
BDO and David Wiener & Co are quasi-captive entities MDCA used to structure its dubious accounting strategies.
Tax deductible intangibles and goodwill have declined from 100% tax deductible in 2013 to only 16% in 2015.
MDCAs former auditor KPMG expressed an adverse opinion on the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting. MDCA soon after hired BDO.
The BDO audit partner assigned to MDCA, after MDCAs switch from KPMG to BDO, was sued in Nussdorf v BDO Seidman for promoting fraudulent & illegal tax shelters.
Deferred acquisition considerations paid out to acquired companies partners may be taxed at ordinary income.
Dubious related party transactions continue, despite Miles Nadals departure, e.g. Lori Senecals husband hired last year & compensated $1 million for 5 months work.",Accounting Fraud,Capital structure;too much debt;possibleAccounting Fraud;accounting misrepresentation,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"MDC Partners, Inc.

The deal involves MPET issuing 122 million shares to a company with leased land and an idea. The deal-makers have added around $37 million to this reverse merger that the market has suddenly valued at a ludicrous $700 million-plus.

The men behind the deal would have probably been pleased if the stock had remained around $1.40 per share for a valuation of about $170 million  or nearly quadruple their money.

It would be surprising if this idea works a decade from now  sorry to say most of these just won't make it nearly that long. Meanwhile, investors will endure a ton of dilution.

This is ludicrous. Complete bubble insanity.

""This happens in biotech. There's at least 10-20 of these a year where you just have a drug that never should have been developed, by a management team that doesn't know what they're doing. The company doesn't have any cash, and they're just praying to hit the lotto and unfortunately they wont. That's kind of what I think is going to happen to Mast.""

In the report, Cold Shower said that M/A-COM was a debt-burdened, no-growth company that had relied on acquisitions to create the illusion of growth and had blatantly claimed acquired revenue as organic to boost reported results. Cold Shower also noted other accounting and reporting ""shenanigans"" at M/A-COM and said that the company's revenue recognition changes and ""creative"" non-GAAP accounting were blatant violations of SEC Regulation G. It also said that M/A-COM's management had grossly misrepresented past results in its investor commentary, and Cold Shower added that M/A-COM's three growth opportunities were still out of reach after years of hype and that the company faced a mark-to-reality ahead.

On 7-27-2016, Cold Shower published a follow-up report on M/A-COM, commenting on the ""charade of lies"" in the company's F3Q16 earnings call. Cold Shower said that M/A-COM had confirmed the PON market was declining, and it said that the company had pushed out its ramp of GaN from mid-2016 to the first half of 2017. It said that the ramp of 100G lasers that the company publicly stated had already commenced in C1Q16 was suddenly retracted, and Cold Shower said that the promised ""real inflection point of full scale production"" of MPAR tiles in 2017 would no longer happen. Cold Shower also said that the company had changed its non-GAAP net income calculation again to not only hide but actually include its temporary benefit to earnings from discontinued operations.","We believe M/A-COMs charade of deceit began with a smoke and mirrors based IPO in 2012. With the help of its bankers and loyal sell-side analysts, MTSI was positioned as a turnaround with its re-energized new product pipeline driving organic growth acceleration. Through the subsequent years of failed promises and organic revenue declines, MTSI has relied on acquisitions to create the illusion of growth, while management has blatantly claimed acquired revenue as organic to boost reported results. We believe the Companys liberal revenue recognition changes and creative Non-GAAP accounting that may appear straightforward on the surface, are blatant violations of SEC Regulation G and warrant an immediate SEC investigation. We also document material alterations to past quarter Non-GAAP presentations and pro-forma accounting treatments that vary quarter-to-quarter. Never shy about using forward-looking statements under the auspices of Safe Harbor language, we believe MTSI management has grossly misrepresented past results in its investor commentary. As we illustrate, SEC filings and investor materials have repeatedly diverged from managements verbal commentary. MTSI has repeatedly winked and nodded about business opportunities measured in billions of dollars, all of which are always at the cusp of inflection or already ramping. Our analysis documents how none of these past stories have materialized in a tangible manner or have stemmed the secular decline in its core business. The latest growth story is premised on three product areas, each supposedly capable of doubling MTSI revenue in 3  5 years. However, unsettling discoveries from reputable sources, such as reports to Congress and documents from the FCC, NOAA and FAA, make it clear to us that two of these so-called opportunities (GaN and Active Antennas) are essentially R&D initiatives that are 5  10 years away from meaningful adoption (if they ever happen at all). The third story, datacenter 100G, is still in the concept stage and requires drastic cost reductions before meeting necessary price points. Despite the emerging holes in its story, MTSI management continues to set a lofty goal of 30% revenue CAGR, which stands in stark contrast to the Companys negative 6% organic revenue CAGR over the past four fiscal years. There are four factors that have driven MTSIs severe dislocation from economic reality. First, prior to its IPO, MTSI was 66% owned by its Chairman and majority holder John Ocampo. While concentrated ownership is often aligned with shareholder interests, Mr. Ocampos incessant selling may suggest his incentives to go the extra mile to maximize valuation may have blurred the line with accurate messaging. Second, MTSI was a hodge-podge of unexciting microwave components in secular decline (Fords SYNCTM system was the growth component), which meant management required a Cinderellas story. Third, MTSIs leadership included a first time CEO. As a result, we have not found the typical conservative and transparent approach to investor communication. Instead, we believe Mr. Croteau has played fast-and-loose with numbers, while grossly underestimating the risks of misrepresentations and projections that are decoupled from reality. Fourth, MTSI has perpetuated the charade and illusion of growth through significant acquisitions in December in each of the last three years. To wit, MTSI has become an investment bankers dream, which we would surmise may be a contributor to the lenient analysis and favorable ratings espoused by the sellside. While the carrot of future growth opportunities has been consistently dangled to investors, insiders have unloaded hundreds of millions of dollars of shares. The borrow-acquire-grow and make promises about the future game fails to work once investors lose confidence. With the analysis herein, the toothpaste will be out of the bottle. In our opinion, as that occurs, management will be hard pressed to explain the voluminous unhedged and irresponsible promises from past conference calls. Based on the rampant insider selling, this could present a major problem for management based on questionable revenue recognition changes and other deceptive tactics. When the dust settles, investors will see MTSI for what it is: a business that has organically missed the original fiscal year estimates by a staggering $32 million the last four years, representing a 7.8% average annual shortfall. As the truth emerges, we expect the business to be valued for what it is  a debt-burdened, no-growth company in need of a hard expectation reset and a proper turnaround under a different management team",Overvalued by markets,accounting misrepresentation;too many acquisitions;too much debt;organic growth overstated,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"M/A-COM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc.

Kerrisdale added that ClubCorps acquisition-driven growth strategy was a ""value-destroying failure"" and that its $1 billion in debt left little room for genuine growth initiatives or additional acquisitions. Kerrisdale also said that demographics ensured the permanent decline in golf was just beginning and that ClubCorp's prospects for long-term organic growth were low. It said that the company's highly capital-intensive business faced low-loyalty and high-churn, and Kerrisdale noted that the ClubCorp's large contingent liabilities posed serious risks.

On 4-12-2016, Kerrisdale published a rebuttal to counterarguments from equity analysts. Kerrisdale said that ClubCorp's past reinvention activity would not grant it a reprieve from future capex, and it said that a few individual examples of reinvention projects did not prove that reinventions drove overall growth. Kerrisdale added that high maintenance capex, low growth and low returns on capital were enduring features of the company's business model, and it said that the economics of ClubCorp's acquisition strategy were not compelling. Kerrisdale also said that ClubCorp's membership deposits were ""real liabilities"" and posed a serious threat to the company's solvency.

On 7-14-2016, ClubCorp reported that during the twelve weeks ended 7-14-2016, the company repurchased 104,325 shares under its share repurchase plan.","Theres a good reason that the overwhelming majority of golf courses in the United States are
owned and operated by non-profit entities: golf is a bad business. Its extremely capitalintensive,
and its unit-level growth is inherently limited. Its also in the midst of a decade-long
decline that, based on demographic trends, will likely get much worse before it gets better.
ClubCorp keeps doubling down (and levering up) on golf, but its mediocre returns barely cover
its cost of capital, and its massive debt load puts it in a precarious position, especially when its
low-loyalty, high-churn model is acutely susceptible to economic downturns. At some point, it
will also have to face reality and crystallize its thus-far unrealized deposit liability. To those
standing in the way of these fearsome risks in return for a bond-like 5% free-cash-flow yield, we

NovaGold owns 50% of two exploration properties, consisting of the Donlin Gold project in Alaska and Galore Creek in Canada.

Expected expenses are massive. The prospects are iffy. The risks are enormous. And the excavation route goes straight through investors wallets.

The company hasnt responded to our request for comment but investors may find various viewpoints here.

Meanwhile, here are the chief reasons TheStreetSweeper believes this blinding stock rally  up 11 percent in three months - is merely a flash in the pan:

*Donlin Gold project:

No operations. No revenue. The project awaits government approval for over 100 permits. The open-pit mining operations arent expected to start up until 2020.

          *Proven and potential gold reserves: While NovaGold reports reserves of 7.7 proven metric tons and probable reserves of 497, no precise data exists showing how much gold may be there or whether any is recoverable, and company expectations are not statements of fact, as stated here and here.  Additionally, acid mine drainage, possibly thousands of pounds of mercury releases, cyanide effects and increased river barge traffic top the projects environmental risks.

         *Cost to design & build Donlin Gold: $6.679 billion.       

         *NovaGolds portion of costs:  $3.34 billion.

*Galore Creek project:

No gold recovered despite numerous attempts since 2003. NovaGold and its partner ran out of money for the copper-gold-silver project and suspended construction in 2007 when they discovered construction would cost around $5 billion.

          *Current status: In February 2011, the former president declared, Galore Creek is one of the most significant copper-gold projects in the world. Eight months later, NovaGold began trying to sell its 50% stake. In 2012, the company said it expected a sale by the end of the year. Still waiting.

*Unfortunate promotional activity:

No obvious recent professional promotions; but the stock trader prosecuted for stock manipulation at age 15 -  Jonathan Lebed - successfully hyped NovaGold through his Lebed Biz in 2010 to $11.62 per share. Red Chip also promoted the company in the same time frame.",Other information,Natural resources value overstated,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,NovaGold Resources Inc. ,NYSE MKT,fy2016,1,,NovaGold Resources Inc.,IQ876453,Gold,TSX:NG,30.274,0,-33.846,75,0,0.033,105.274,0,0,0,0,10.263,1.51,20.146,1.149,0,0,0,107.338,0.033,0,43.417,0,-0.324,43.417,-20.179,0,243.472,-3.674,0,0,-32.42,0,408.261,0,-8.937,0.533,-32.42,0,0,0.277,0,0,-32.697,0,0,-1.149,0,3.051,0,0,84.812,-33.846,1.288,0,0,1.784,0,0,0,107.998,-33.846,0,0,-32.697,0,1942.451,-0.10584,0,-1705.901,-0.10225,0,0,319.774,0,300.263,-0.10584,0,300.263,-0.10225,-4.275,408.261,319.774,0,-0.06337,0,-0.06337,43488,42704,-20.146,0,320.01581,-28.965,-4.275,321.52928,-11.457,(Invalid Formula 0me),-20.179,0.93828,0,300.263,0,0,0.93828,-20.2625,0.327,84.812,0,0,0,NM,-4.38025,84.812,0,-1.53588,-20.462,4.551,-0.78,385.075,0.346,-20.146,13,-0.069,898

GeoInvesting also said that the last corporate action of Noah's two controlling shareholders was to arbitrarily increase their voting interest from 30.7% to 64%, and GeoInvesting noted that only two-thirds of the company's voting power was needed to pass significant resolutions including going-private. GeoInvesting added that its wealth management segment was showing sequential decline, that its asset management segment faced challenges and that its internet finance segment would be hit by government regulation. (GeoInvesting first released the report to its subscribers earlier that morning.)

On 3-17-2016, GeoInvesting commented on Noah's 2015 earnings report and noted that the company missed on both top and bottom line. GeoInvesting said that Noah only came as close as it did to meeting estimates through an abnormally lower effective tax rate of 8.9% for Q4 2015, as well as abnormally high investment income of $3.8 million for Q4 2015. GeoInvesting said it was unlikely the company would meet its guidance for the coming year.

On 4-7-2016, in its March 2016 newsletter, GeoInvesting said that continued pressure on Chinese equities would lead to an unimpressive performance for Noahs legacy businesses, and it said that the company was not investable.","NOAH is in the business of managing wealth, with their revenue tied closely to the performance of the assets that they manage

(In 2013, OCZ declared bankruptcy.)

On 10-6-2015, after the campaign closed, the SEC announced that it had charged former OCZ executives with accounting fraud and other accounting failures.","OCZ has parlayed investor and market excitement for solid state drives (SSDs) into an amazing story. From a low of $1.79 last summer, OCZ's stock has steadily climbed more than 350% on a feel good tale told by its CEO. But there is a much darker and sinister side that has been well hidden. It is our opinion that OCZ has misrepresented its SSD growth and has financial irregularities that are nearly impossible to reconcile. We believe that some form of a restatement may be required and that the auditors tick and tie review has some substantial inconsistencies. As such, we have sent our findings to the Securities and Exchange Commission asking for clarification on the multiple sets of numbers that we have uncovered. We believe OCZ's Board has the fiduciary responsibility to form a special committee to examine these discrepancies.

 

But the misrepresentations are not confined to the financials. A scathing lawsuit and industry reviews suggest OCZ has misrepresented product specs and performance. Additionally, a recently completed secondary failed to disclose the CEO's criminal record, major underwriter conflicts (until the final prospectus), and contained financial results that were different from past filings. And if that is not enough, there are other confusing pieces to the story such as Fusion-io, STEC, and Smart Modular disclosing that they do not see OCZ in competitive situations.

October 2016: FDA is actively moving to down classify BGS from Class III to Class II, allowing cheap competition to flood in, stealing revenues and crushing margins.

Clear accounting manipulation by 26% demonstrated in recent quarters, Orthofix is currently grossly overvalued as a high growth player with a strong moat. (WRONG !).

Following the FDA move, expect Orthofix quickly to fall by at least 50% (share price of around $15-17).",Legal Headwinds,regulatory headwinds,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,Orthofix International N.V. ,Nasdaq,fy2016,1,,Orthofix Medical Inc.,IQ32538,Health Care Equipment,NasdaqGS:OFIX,39.572,409.788,3.056,0,87.453,22.41,39.572,87.453,0,57.848,322.335,15.966,57.848,260.696,0,63.346,28.803,0.392,194.373,0,-5.284,173.867,0,-1.771,48.916,32.836,0,0,0.763,0,61.026,33.52,0,372.103,-14.496,59.076,14.353,19.024,-16.432,0,15.527,0,0,3.497,0,0,-0.441,0,83.441,0,-1.902,0,3.056,0,0,0,-21.947,0,-0.4,0,108.626,3.056,0,0,3.497,0,1.783,0.16843,0,64.179,0.19274,0,0,18.14402,0,263.477,0.16611,19.72,263.477,0.19,-65.832,372.103,18.46316,0,1.15465,0,1.13469,43521,42735,55.246,0,17.82816,55.246,-46.112,17.94654,-9.722,(Invalid Formula 0me),32.836,14.7787,58.246,202.451,3,0.7,11.35569,20.95,4.4,0,0,0,0,81.6179,35.8055,0,0,35.8055,-39.572,0,4.759,263.477,5.067,38.814,938,10.46,902

Pearson added that recorded statements from the company's CEO regarding Stability were ""wildly"" at odds with what Osiris disclosed in its SEC filings and had likely led to the resignation of the company's auditor. He said that Osiris faced either substantial restatements or an auditor resignation.

On 1-19-2016, Osiris said that use of dated 2014 external data was not reflective of Osiris Grafix sales in 2015, and it said that it had established important distribution relationships with industry-leading marketing partners in the prior year.

Osiris also disclosed that the company's unaudited interim and audited annual financial statements previously issued for 2014 and its unaudited interim financial statements previously issued for the three and nine months ended 9-30-2015 should not be relied upon due to errors related to the timing of revenue recognition under contracts with distributors. Osiris additionally disclosed that it had received a subpoena from the SEC, which Osiris said was conducting a non-public investigation relating to the company's historic accounting practices.

On 3-22-2016, the company announced that it had received a notice from the Nasdaq stating that Osiris was not in compliance with listing rules because Osiris did not timely file its 10-K for the year ended 12-31-2015.

Pearson also commented on a Seattle Post-Intelligencer article from 3-18-2016 that said Advanced BioHealing Inc. executive Todd Clawson and others paid kickbacks to VA podiatrists and clinicians who promoted the companys product, a ""biologic wound dressing, and that Clawson had been charged with conspiracy to commit criminal conflicts of interest, bribery and health care fraud. Pearson said Clawson had recently been Osiris' national director of sales and marketing but that he was no longer with Osiris.

On 5-16-2016, Osiris announced that it had received a letter from the Nasdaq stating that Osiris was not in compliance with listing rules because Osiris did not timely file its 10-Q for the quarter ended 3-31-2016.

On 10-7-2016, the company announced that a Nasdaq hearings panel had granted the company's request for a stay of the delisting of the companys common stock until such time as the Nasdaq hearings panel made a decision on the merits following a hearing.

On 11-7-2016, the company reported preliminary 2014 and 2015 revenue and anticipated 2016 revenue. Shares closed up 24% the next day.

In the presentation, Spruce Point's Ben Axler said that Planet had a questionable business strategy, unachievable revenue goals and unsustainable margins. Axler also said that the company was a ""glorified equipment reseller,"" and he noted that Planet faced rapidly rising competition in the fitness space, with no barriers to entry. Axler additionally said that Planet had issues with its equipment purchases/resales accounting.

On 3-9-2016, ValueWalk reported on Axler's presentation the prior day. Axler said that Planet had a tax liability that could ""explode"" up to $700 million, and he estimated 50% downside.

Later that day, Spruce Point published a 64-slide presentation on Planet, which criticized the company's accounting and financial disclosures, including possible lack of transparency, aggressive ""gross"" revenue accounting for equipment to bolster top line revenue, aggressive definition of ""active"" members to include pre-sales, undisclosed deficit spending in its national advertising fund, understatement of tax benefits payable, misclassification of placement revenue, weak internal controls and governance concerns. Spruce Point also said that Planet faced an unrealistic goal of quadrupling its club base, and it said that because Planet imposed guidelines that franchisees must purchase new equipment from its own entity and replace cardio and fitness equipment every four and six years, Planet risked push-back from its marginally profitable franchisees.
","Questionable Business Strategy with Unachievable Revenue Goals: The fitness industry is intensely competitive, subjecting Planet to the
whim of changing consumer preferences (yoga, boot camp, barre burn, adventure courses), potential technology disruption from
wearables, and rife with examples of chains that over-expanded and failed (e.g. Bally Total Fitness, Curves, Town Sports). Planet Fitness
(Planet or PLNT) tries to differentiate itself with a no judgment model for the casual fitness user that doesnt want to be
gymtimidated, at no-commitment, and a low entry price of $10/month (plus initiation fees). On average, its clubs have 6,500 members,
and it needs both densely populated markets and members who wont use its gyms to make its financial model work! Furthermore, we
believe Planets revenue targets and growth rate are unrealistic and likely to disappoint current expectations. According to a former
Planet insider, Planet appears to have created a pre-IPO fairytale goal that it can quadruple its club base from over 1,000 to 4,000
locations, so unrealistic that it implies massive market share of approx. 40% and would severely cannibalize existing locations. With no
barriers to entry, competitors have already replicated Planets look, pricing plan, and specialty black card model. Weve identified over
700 +comparable clubs with sub $20/month pricing that all are targeting Planets core customers. With its competitive advantage
disappearing, we fear Planet will be left to compete solely on price - a proven deflationary force in the fitness industry. Highlighting our
concerns, we note Planets net income and operating cash flow barely grew in 2015 despite highlighting top line growth! Planet appears to
be trying hard to keep members from cancelling, but in the process has aggravated customers resulting in scores of internet complaints
and Better Business Bureau citations. At the extreme, even a class action lawsuit from former club members has been filed claiming unfair
cancellation terms! Is it a surprise that Planet doesnt disclose member churn? Signs of financial strain are manifesting itself in 2015 from
rapidly rising bad debt expense and Planets explosion in marketing and advertising costs to recruit new members. However, by our
estimate, Planets National Advertising Fund recently operated at a deficit despite a hefty requirement that 2% and 7% of total gross
monthly dues must be used for national and local advertising, respectively.
2 Planet is Really A Glorified Gym Equipment Seller With Unsustainable Margins: Over 95% of Planets clubs are franchise-owned, but
counter to appearances, equipment is more meaningful than appreciated at 43% of its sales and 26% of its EBITDA coming from high
margin equipment sales to franchises. According to Planets 2015 Franchise Disclosure Document, it imposes guidelines that franchisees
must purchase new equipment from its own entity, Planet Fitness Equipment LLC, and replace cardio and fitness equipment every 4 and 6
years, respectively; however, not as reoccurring as it appears. With a total estimated upfront cost to own a new franchise at $728k - $3.7m,
re-equipment costs at $320-$784k in years 4-6, and location remodeling costs of $75k - $550k every 4 years, Planet risks aggravating and
receiving push back from the marginally profitable franchisees that may decide it is not worth the cost to re-equip. Planet has to walk a fine
line in appeasing its current franchisees, which were responsible for opening 90% of new locations in 2015 and are expected to be a major
driver of its ambitious growth plan! We believe that Planet has made concessions to sacrifice equipment margins in an effort to boost its
effective royalty rate and scale it toward 5%. The reason for this is simple: Planet hopes to convince Wall St. analysts it should get a higher
valuation for more royalty payments! Planets equipment margins have also benefitted from supplier rebates, but like other financial
matters related to its equipment sales, Planet does not gives much disclosure into the exact impact t
Accounting and Financial Disclosure: Planet IPOed in Aug 2015 under the Jobs Act, but in our opinion, should not be excused from a
plethora of questionable issues including: 1) Its lack of transparency on key performance metrics (e.g. member churn) and scant
disclosure of its performance targets post-IPO, 2) Potentially flawed / aggressive gross revenue accounting for equipment to
bolster its top line revenue, 3) Aggressive definition of active members to include pre-sales, 4) Appearance of undisclosed deficit
spending in Planets Advertising Fund, 5) Potential understatement of the tax benefits payable by $569m, 6) Potential
misclassification of placement revenue tied to equipment in franchise revenue (and related costs placed in SG&A), and 7) Weak
internal controls leading to the sentencing to prison of a Planet Fitness corporate systems manager in Jan 2016 who stole $1m
through a fraudulent invoice scheme.

Governance Concerns: Planets road to the pubic markets is not without controversy. For example, New Hampshires governor failed
to disclose his ties to Planet both as an investor and Board member while lobbying state legislators for a tax change to benefit Planet.
Nor did he reveal that he and former Cabletron Chief Financial Officer David Kirkpatrick (an SEC investigated individual) played a
crucial role in the effort to take the company public three years ago. Planet was ultimately sold privately, a sale that resulted in two
lawsuits, with one of them being the former CFO who accused Planet of securities fraud. Our closer evaluation of Planets
governance reveals additional causes for concern. First, Planets FDD reveals a disclosure that one of its officers owns an indirect
interest in its equipment vendor, Planet Fitness Equipment LLC. This disclosure is not made to investors in its SEC filings. Upon review
of prior FDD documents, we also identified instances of related party steering of business to franchisee owned vendors (related
parties), also not disclosed in SEC filings, and which could disadvantage shareholders and other franchisees. Investors should be
cautioned that management is held accountable primarily to members of TSG Consumer, a private equity firm that controls 65% of
the voting power and 4 of 8 Board seats. Planet provides no transparency on target metrics its management must achieve to attain
cash bonuses; as a result, management can potentially fail to meet public guidance, and still get paid handsomely! Valuation Disconnect and Downside Catalyst: Valued at 5.5x 2017E sales and 13x 2017E EBITDA, Wall St. has embraced the Planet
story with 11 analysts saying Buy and setting an avg. target of $20.20/sh (+25% upside). In setting lofty price targets, analysts
stretch comparisons of Planets business to include healthy living comps (supermarkets e.g. Whole Foods), fast food operators
(e.g. Chipotle), and clothing retailers (e.g. Michael Kors); absurd comparisons to industries with different business risks! Planet
would like credit from investors for being a high value franchisor, but in our view, Planets valuation should be anchored toward gym
equipment makers (given its dependence on equipment sales), and to other clubs such as Life Time fitness (recently privatized) and
Town Sports. Analysts also fail to account for a hefty tax liability, which could saddle shareholders with debts of $1.40 -$7.20 / share!
We apply a 7x -10x EBITDA multiple and arrive at a price target of $4.65 - $12.00 /sh ($8.00 at the midpoint, or ~50% downside). We
estimate Planets private equity backer has a 3x return on its investment, and a big concentration of shares in its portfolio (est. 20%).
As a result, we expect a large secondary to act as an overhang and downside catalyst",Strategy,strategy issues;corporate governance problem;industry saturation;accounting misrepresentation;inappropriate valuation methods,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Planet Fitness, Inc.

It added that the company would also face broader market headwinds in the coming year. GeoInvesting additionally questioned Raven's only organic growth project, a ""speculative experimental stage project"" with Google to offer Wi-Fi using stratospheric balloons, which GeoInvesting said was arcane in an age of drones.

On 3-23-2016, Raven announced that its board had increased its share repurchase authorization to spend up $10 million dollars once the prior $40 million authorization limitation had been reached.","Summary

Almost all of Raven Industries (NMS:RAVN) products are tied to the price of commodities  both hard and soft  all of which have been sharply lower across the board for the last two years with no signs of stabilizing
This has led to enormous downward pressure and momentum in Ravens earnings and sales, both of which have deteriorated significantly over the last few fiscal years

The Street Sweeper additionally said that the unprofitable company's debt interest costs to support its planned acquisitions would be ""substantial."" The Street Sweeper added that the roll-up had reported significant losses from continuing business operations since emerging from 2010 bankruptcy proceedings under its legacy business, and it said that Real faced other risks from unknown litigation costs and dropping aluminum prices.

And investors will find a ludicrous 1,037 P/E, while the scrap metal industry's P/E is just 11.

Stocks trading at extremely high P/E ratios are great stocks to avoid. Overvalued stocks are more likely to suffer future losses than stocks trading at lower P/Es.

Add the enormous P/E ratio to recent insider selling and investors can begin to glimpse the downside risks that suggest Real can't turn recycled aluminum, net operating losses and face cream into gold.

Investors may find other viewpoints here. Meanwhile, let's consider those ramping risks:

*1. Net Carry Forward: Not Real Revenue

A couple of promotional pieces, here, have apparently been misinterpreted, resulting in support for Reals stock price. The piece comments that the company operates on a plan of taking tax advantages based on net operating losses (NOLs).

An NOL is not the way to build a business.

Only a truly troubled company would try to build a reputation on taking a tax advantage based on losing millions of dollars.

Yet someone holding shares of the stock has gone out and promoted that effort on the Seeking Alpha financial website.

The author wrote: ""We are happy with the performance so far. We didn't buy the stock only for its aluminum business, we bought it because of the NOLs, and the management's disciplined capital allocation.""

Racking up losses and calling them tax benefits - and then having someone crow about it - may work for a little while.

But to take advantage of those losses, the company has to have a positive operating income - something Real has missed in three of the last four years.",Overvalued by markets,Legal headwinds;regulatory headwinds;strategy issues;business model pressure,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,"Real Industry, Inc.

The Street Sweeper said that the company's financials were poor, however, and pointed out that months prior to the reverse stock split the company had been downgraded from junk status by the S&P. The Street Sweeper cited a cash decline to $424,000 from $9 million in December, $639 million in liabilities, the sale of assets to pay off debts and a drop in revenues.","Reverse splits like this are always a sign of horrible things to come. Typically, companies engineer reverse splits to clean up a mess, and the stock pops not on the merits of the business but because investors perceive less risk.

In the blink of an eye, then, such shares plunge back down, often on another dilutive stock offering.

In fact, researchers have found reverse splits continue to lose value: ""These stocks record statistically significant negative abnormal returns over the three-year period following the month of the reverse split.""

Pile that reverse split on top of the abrupt drop in oil prices and change in leadership, massive financial concerns and the financial institutions' absurd reports -- and Resolute looks like an irresolvable mess poised to drop about 70%.

Sabre Corp. (Nasdaq: SABR) is a travel tech company with a core business of operating a Global Distribution System (GDS),
a platform that facilitates travel by bringing together content such as inventory, prices, and availability from a broad array of
travel suppliers for a range of travel buyers such as online/physical travel agents and corporate travel departments. As a
middleman between buyers and suppliers, Sabres biggest risk is disintermediation, whereby its consumers bypass its
network, through emerging threats from Google, or even worse, suppliers imposing fees to customers for using it (e.g.
Lufthansa). To keep customers happy and loyal, Sabre must offer upfront cash incentives because its contracts are typically
short-term, and upwards of 20% of contracts renew annually. Our research suggests that Sabre has been offering increasing
incentive discounts (obscured by its Adjusted EBITDA), which has forced deflationary pricing as evident in declining revenue
per transaction. Sabre came public in 2014 after a highly promoted going private LBO in 2007 during the pre-financial crisis
buyout mania. Our research suggests that despite significant M&A and restructuring at Sabre while under private
ownership, there has been no value creation in its underlying business, which has sorely disappointed expectations. By
ignoring the headline Adjusted EBITDA and EPS results and focusing on underlying cash flow economics, its evident that
Sabre is at best a stagnant business. With Sabres share price +80% since its IPO, it is no surprise its private equity sponsors
have rapidly exited the stock through 4 secondary issuances, and reduced ownership from 80% at the IPO to 25% today!
2 Management Quietly Starts Liquidating Ahead of the Questionable Related-Party Acquisition of Abacus Intl:
As a result of underlying business pressures, we believe insiders were likely aware that revenue and earnings estimates
would not be met in 2015. Management quietly announced on the Q1 2015 conference call in May that it would start
liquidating shares under a 10b5-1 program. Realizing that Wall Street punishes earnings misses for growth stories
fiercely, and needing a cover-up to beat estimates, in our opinion, Sabre announced the acquisition of Abacus, its Asian
GDS affiliate. Sabre already owned 65%, and spun the transaction as a way to access faster growing markets, but theres
evidence to suggest the transaction may have allowed the company to spring-load revenue and provide a band aid to an
injured business. Not surprisingly, by adjusting Sabres results for the consolidation of Abacus, Sabres Travel Network
segment barely grew in 2015, yet management is still touting mid to high single digit organic growth!

Spruce Point Sees $12 - $17 Per Share;
40% - 60% Downside
Evidence That Suggests Accounting Shenanigans To Inflate Operating Cash Flow and EBITDA:
To support our concerns about the Abacus deal, we sourced its Singapore financial filings and were disappointed to find
discrepancies between the Abacus figures reported by Sabre to investors in its SEC filings. Even worse, we found
irregularities related to Sabres JV accounting that suggest it artificially inflated its operating cash flow by representing
excess dividends (returns of capital) as operating cash flows, when accounting rules dictate that dividends in excess of
earnings should be treated as investment cash flows. By pro forma adjusting the results, we find that Sabres operating
cash flows declined in 2015, while management represented that it increased! Aggressive accounting strategies appear to
be the norm with Sabre. Our forensic analysis suggests Sabre has become more aggressive in capitalizing upfront customer
incentives, which artificially increases both Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EBITDA. Investors are better served adjusting
Sabres financials to remove the effects of capitalization. As a result, we find Sabres EBITDA margin actually declined in
2015, but of course, management would like you to believe they expanded...oh the miracles of financial alchemy! Not
surprisingly, managements cash bonuses, along with its sponsors management fees, are solely linked to reported
Adjusted EBITDA. This linkage provides clear incentives to game the Adjusted EBITDA figures.

Valuation Disconnect Suggesting 40%  60% Downside:
Smelling a fee bonanza from repeated equity + debt issuances, a grand total of 13 analysts all have Buy recommendations
and see upside to an average price target of $33.45 (+15%). In our opinion, its easy to refute the bull case from analysts
flawed investment assumptions. At approx. 3.4x and 10.5x 2016E Street sales and Adj. EBITDA estimates, respectively, Sabre
seems fairly valued to peers (on inflated street numbers) Amadeus and Travelport. During the heavily touted LBO, venerated
investment bankers at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley issued a fairness opinion suggesting a terminal EBITDA multiple
range of 6.5x  8.0x. Given our belief that post-LBO, no underlying financial improvement has been created, and at worst
accounting gimmicks are masking deterioration, we find it baffling how analysts justify the current valuation. Furthermore,
analysts fail to adjust their models for Sabres $387m tax receivable liability that starts coming due in 2017 and has real
cash implications. We also adjust Sabres financials for the aggressive capitalization of recurring and normal upfront cash
incentives. As a result, we derive a long-term price target of $12.00 - $17.00 per share, or 40-60% downside",Accounting Fraud,Accounting misrepresentation;Related party transactions;Corporate governance issues,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Sabre Corporation,Nasdaq,fy2016,1,,Sabre Corporation,IQ254517933,Data Processing and Outsourced Services,NasdaqGS:SABR,364.114,3373.387,242.562,0,2275.002,200.728,364.114,2275.002,0,400.667,1098.385,48.524,426.911,578.753,-19.478,0,0,-12.949,853.381,0,0,1740.17,0,56.787,753.279,519.632,22.663,25.582,-158.251,0,3323.884,370.778,0,5724.57,-42.743,679.922,168.576,328.035,-327.647,0,86.645,0,177.591,241.39,-164.12,0,5.549,0,1166.358,0,0,3276.281,242.562,45.959,0,0,-445.808,2.579,-19.065,0,5098.955,242.562,1055,0,237.013,1055,2.854,0.87395,0,-1141.116,0.85396,-999.868,-221.746,277.546,-999.868,623.036,0.85962,27.344,625.615,0.84,-100,5724.57,282.752,0,0.81918,0,0.80409,43511,42735,720.36,-144.355,0,723.14,-190.025,277.12901,42.982,(Invalid Formula 0me),519.632,2.24964,746.36,-2700.848,26,151.495,-9.75212,227.35925,39.032,3453.872,0,55.132,177.591,26.4133,576.25613,3276.281,59.5126,665.552,3089.758,0,-150.195,4079.487,38.191,392.713,10000,48.454,921

Kerrisdale additionally said that SAGE-547's superficially good results were in reality underwhelming because the condition resolved itself spontaneously in about two-thirds of cases and that the drug was at best a ""Band-Aid.""

","SAGE-547 is more of the same. While Sage management naturally touts its lead drug as a great advance, the truth is far more prosaic. As one group of researchers put it, Many of the behavioural and physiological effects of allopregnanolone [the active ingredient in SAGE-547] are similar to those of benzodiazepines and other positive modulators of the GABA-A receptor, such as barbiturates and ethanol (1). All of these drugs act to strengthen the brains existing inhibitory mechanisms in similar ways, and patients with super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) have, by definition, received many of them already. Indeed, as we discuss below, some of Sages own data demonstrate that SAGE-547 tends to have little physiological impact in such patients: soon after receiving the drug, many patients experienced no change or even an adverse change in their suppression ratios (an electrographic measure of inhibition), and even the positive responses were modest in size. Sages story is that its drug is unique because it binds to GABAA receptors not just at synapses but beyond them, in the so-called extrasynaptic region of the neuronal membrane, where such receptors can generate a steady (tonic) form of inhibition that differs from the better-known spikes of phasic inhibition. But, while its true that most benzodiazepines, which constitute the first line of treatment in SRSE, dont bind to most extrasynaptic GABAA receptors, many other standard drugs for treating SRSE do, especially general anesthetics. In Sages Phase 1/2 trial, the most common anesthetics used were midazolam, propofol, pentobarbital, and ketamine; every one of these drugs has been shown to bind to extrasynaptic GABAA receptors and strengthen tonic inhibition, 1 just like SAGE-547 aims to do. Its just not that special. SAGE-547 is, at best, a Band-Aid. By the time patients with status epilepticus are classified as super-refractory, their doctors have already tried and failed to suppress their abnormal brain activity in many different ways, and when they turn to general anesthetics they typically succeed, putting the patients into comas and ending their overt seizures. But this is just a temporary fix, buying time in the hope that the underlying disturbance in the network  the cause of which could range from a traumatic injury to a tumor to an auto-immune attack  resolves itself. No one believes that general anesthesia is itself a cure",Product ineffective,product ineffective;lackluster product,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Sage Therapeutics, Inc.",Nasdaq,fy2016,1,,"Sage Therapeutics, Inc.",IQ141821364,Biotechnology,NasdaqGM:SAGE,168.517,0,-158.987,228.962,120.756,0.281,397.479,120.756,0,0,-120.756,23.02,0,39.407,0,0,0,0,402.579,0,0,1.93,0,7.796,1.388,-160.163,0,0,1.211,0,0,-158.987,0,404.531,0,-118.678,12.817,-158.987,-1.421,0,0,0,0,-158.987,0,0,0,0,35.169,0,0,0,-158.987,-228.594,0,0,-230.015,0,0,0,36.014,-158.987,0,0,-158.987,0,0.004,-4.7469,0,-320.327,-4.7469,0,-0.017,33.4928,0,368.517,-4.75,331.581,368.517,-4.75,0,404.531,33.4928,0,-2.96681,0,-2.96681,43515,42735,-159.882,0,37.22217,-159.882,330.982,37.27018,-17.711,(Invalid Formula 0me),-160.163,9.90047,-157.882,368.517,2,0,9.90047,-99.36688,0,0,0,0,0,0,-61.72188,0,0,-61.72188,-397.479,0,-16.5,368.517,0,-161.303,135,0,922

KGaA's organic growth, EBITDA, operating cash flow and free cash flow were significantly lower than the company reported. Muddy Waters added that Ströer's year-end cash flow statements wrongly showed that it had no borrowings during the year and that the company's auditor had committed a clear error. It also said that Ströer's gross revenue recognition policy obscured real revenue, and Muddy Waters said that the company's lack of impairment for its failed Ballroom acquisition indicated that it misled investors. Muddy Waters said that the company capitalized costs improperly to inflate EBITDA, and it said that Ströer's digital organic growth rate was actually only 2.5% in 2015. Muddy Waters also questioned multiple other aspects of Ströer's ""China style"" governance and internal controls.

Around the time of the report's release, Muddy Waters' Carson Block also appeared on Bloomberg to discuss Ströer in an interview.

Later that day, Ströer responded to Muddy Waters' report and said that its underlying business outlook was excellent. The company also said that the report was ""far fetched, at least tendentious and overall groundless,"" and it said that Ströer was considering legal options.","Well, it turns out that Ströers claimed digital organic growth rates are way off from what we can calculate. We see Digital organic growth rates of only 2.2% in 2014, and 2.5% (using adjustments we believe are more reflective of the business) to 16.4% (using the companys methodology) in 2015. Maybe Ströers digital foray makes as much sense as wanting to be sucked into your computer in order to get physical media implants. The billboard business strikes us as a real estate business. It is our view that much of the business revolves around knowing commuting patterns and neighborhood demographics, dealing with planning departments, negotiating leases with property owners, schmoozing with government employees, managing construction, securing adequate insurance, detecting structural problems and managing maintenance, working with industrial printers, managing logistics, etc., etc. Billboards seem to us like a fairly old school, hard-nosed business.Perhaps theres a good reason why Ströer seems unique among OOH advertising companies in aggressively pursuing online business. Why is it that large U.S. OOH companies with relatively easy access to Silicon Valley seemingly havent caught onto Ströers opportunity set? Probably for the same reason Sergei Brin, Larry Page, Jerry Yang, and Mark Zuckerberg were not in commercial real estate before founding online marketing powerhouses  there seems to be little overlap. When we scratch the surface at Ströer, we see a company that to us appears far less successful in online than the market seems to think. Moreover, we see a company whose insiders have spun a great story, but with seemingly little substance; and, while telling the story, have engaged in more highly questionable self-dealing than weve ever seen outside of a Chinese company.

On 10-13-2016, Green Equity Investors filed a 13D and reported a 8.8% stake.","Of most concern to skeptical analysts is Signets reliance on an unusual accounting method to determine which customer accounts are past due and could go bad -- an approach they fear could underestimate future losses in light of Signets expanded credit business.
Asked about its accounting and financing practices, Signet said it has disciplined credit standards and decades of experience to minimize losses.
In the U.S. market, offering financing benefits our guests and managing the process in-house is a strength of Signets Sterling Jewelers division, the company said in a statement in response to questions from Bloomberg.
Indeed, the companys annual numbers seem to bear that out. In the last four years, the percentage of Signets accounts receivable classified as nonperforming has held steady, at 3.6 percent to 3.8 percent of the companys gross loan portfolio. Those figures fall within the general band for delinquencies, near 4 percent, at private-label credit cards managed by banks.
But Donn Vickrey, a forensic account at Pacific Square Research of San Diego, says the companys bad debt expense is a potential hazard worth watching. Other analysts agree.
Private-label card loans go bad, says David Ritter, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. They tend to be the first bill that doesnt get paid when you have problems.
Proprietary Records
The company rejects the notion that it is taking on greater credit risks. The software used for credit decisions, it says, is built on decades worth of proprietary records on consumer behavior and provides a more refined method of scoring applicants.",Accounting Fraud,Accounting misrepresentation,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Signet Jewelers Limited,NYSE,fy2016,1,,Signet Jewelers Limited,IQ693964,Specialty Stores,NYSE:SIG,137.7,6802.8,467.9,0,4109.8,145.9,137.7,4109.8,0.7,1739.5,2693,16.4,1843.9,1908.7,0,2453.9,0,-189.8,4588.1,0,-46,1676.8,0,-6.4,727.6,782.6,76.3,19.7,-45.9,-25.7,943.3,736.7,0,6464.9,-78.9,443.3,269.1,657.8,-226.5,24.4,189.9,0,33.3,467.9,0,0,0,0,1151.1,0,0,1321,467.9,-2.2,0,0,-228.7,0,-44.7,0,3404.2,467.9,2619.9,0,467.9,2619.9,15.7,5.88553,-47.1,3534.6,5.88553,-2645.9,-495.8,79.5,-2693,3060.7,5.87,5,3060.7,5.87,-130,6464.9,79.7,0,5.79167,0,5.77713,43192,42399,928.5,-67.1,79.4,928.5,-266.6,78.38448,-55.9,(Invalid Formula 0me),782.6,38.54786,1468.8,2117.4,540.3,41.6,26.66751,460.4375,180.1,1378.7,4.1,-73.1,57.7,28.8689,157.0375,1321,14.3406,182.125,1241,0,242.8,4439.4,165.2,702,29057,24.7,926

1. Skyline is low-cash, high-cash-burn and has sold only one unit since 2015.

3. The company is under threat of being delisted from Nasdaq.

4. It recently filed a $20 million offering. Those shares can be sold at any moment, representing a significant dilution event.

(STJ US).1
 There is a strong possibility
that close to half of STJs revenue is about to disappear for approximately two years. STJs
pacemakers, ICDs, and CRTs might  and in our view, should  be recalled and remediated.
(These devices collectively were 46% of STJs 2015 revenue.) Based on conversations with
industry experts, we estimate remediation would take at least two years. Even lacking a recall,
the product safety issues we present in this report offer unnecessary health risks and should
receive serious notice among hospitals, physicians and cardiac patients.
We have seen demonstrations of two types of cyber attacks against STJ implantable cardiac
devices (Cardiac Devices): a crash attack that causes Cardiac Devices to malfunction 
including by apparently pacing at a potentially dangerous rate; and, a battery drain attack that
could be particularly harmful to device dependent users.
2
 Despite having no background in
cybersecurity, Muddy Waters has been able to replicate in-house key exploits that help to enable
these attacks.
We find STJ Cardiac Devices vulnerabilities orders of magnitude more worrying than the
medical device hacks that have been publicly discussed in the past. These attacks take less skill,
can be directed randomly at any STJ Cardiac Device within a roughly 50 foot radius,
theoretically can be executed on a very large scale, and most gallingly, are made possible by the
hundreds of thousands of substandard home monitoring devices STJ has distributed.
3 The STJ
ecosystem, which consists of Cardiac Devices, STJs network, physician office programmers,
and home monitoring devices, has significant vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities highly likely
could be exploited for numerous other types of attacks.
Key vulnerabilities can apparently be exploited by low level hackers. Incredibly, STJ has
literally distributed hundreds of thousands of keys to the castle in the form of home monitoring
units (called Merlin@home) that in our opinion, greatly open up the STJ ecosystem to attacks.
These units are readily available on Ebay, usually for no more than $35. Merlin@homes
generally lack even the most basic forms of security, and as this report shows, can be exploited ",Product ineffective,product dangerous,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"St. Jude Medical, Inc.

The short-seller said that Stamps would be left with insurmountable customer attrition following a recent government settlement on the company's predatory marketing tactics (churn was already at 40%), and it noted that Pitney Bowes just recently launched a Stamps.com competitor two days earlier called SendPro. Using IAC's 4x EBITDA multiple (excluding Match stake), The Friendly Bear set a long-term target price of $25 (about 75% downside).

On 5-9-2016, Stamps announced that its board had approved an increase of $10 million to its existing share repurchase authorization.

On 6-2-2016, The Friendly Bear said that Stamps had changed its business model after its earlier report by adding an online cancellation mechanism, which The Friendly Bear said would produce spiking churn and suggested that Stamps was in violation of its settlement terms. The Friendly Bear also said that the company's 40% organic growth rate was massively overstated and that the figure was based largely around M&A and a one-time bump related to a complicated web of intercompany relationships. The Friendly Bear further said that Stamps had taken revenues that were being remitted to Endicia and repatriated them to Stamps, which it said was an unsustainable bump to revenue. The Friendly Bear said that true organic growth could be as weak as 3-4%, and it reiterated its price target of $25.","Summary

In 2015, Stamps.com was investigated by multiple government authorities for false and misleading advertising practices and never disclosed these investigations to investors.

Stamps.com already has an egregious ~40% customer churn rate and the terms of the settlement appear to make it much harder for the company to attract and retain customers.

As a result, we think Stamps.com is going to be left with insurmountable customer attrition as the government settlements force the company to modify its predatory marketing tactics.

Managements recent decision to stop disclosing churn suggests management is aware the business is going to significantly deteriorate given that the disclosure change came ""coincidentally"" right after a California settlement.

Prescience Point said that Stamps had aligned with undisclosed business affiliates such as IntuiShip to exploit legacy U.S. Postal Service postage reseller discount contracts in order to skim 100%-margin revenue from the USPS. Prescience Point said that Stamps' ""abusive"" scheme violated the intent and purpose of the reseller program and cannibalized USPS volumes. As a result, it said that approximately 65% of Stamps' EBITDA could vanish due to cancellation of the reseller program negotiated service agreements benefiting Stamps. It said that even if the reseller program service agreements were not cancelled, Stamps still faced reevaluation of certain USPS discount agreements beginning in 2017.
","Shares of Stamps.com (STMP, or the company) are grossly overvalued. Just as a review of legal filings resulted in the chance discovery
of Valeants Big Secret, its relationship with undisclosed affiliate Philidor, our review of scores of legal filings has resulted in the uncovering
of STMPs Big Secret  the undisclosed formula behind its astonishing financial results. We have identified undisclosed business affiliates
(e.g., IntuiShip) that STMP has aligned with to exploit legacy USPS postage reseller discount contracts to skim 100%-margin revenue from
the USPS. We believe this scheme is abusive, in that it violates the spirit and intent of these USPS-issued contracts, and that it results in the
cannibalization of USPS business, an expense to US taxpayers but a jackpot for STMP. By our estimates, ~65% of STMPs EBITDA is derived
from this scheme and is at risk of vanishing. Based on our understanding of the arrangements, and certain conversations that The Capitol
Forum, a well-respected regulatory research firm based in Washington DC, has had with the Postal Regulatory Commission and industry
participants, we view this arbitrage scheme as unsustainable and likely to fall apart in the upcoming months.
1
To compound matters, for several reasons elaborated in this report, we have come to view IntuiShip and Stamps.com as essentially
operating as one. One such datapoint comes from a recent report published by The Capitol Forum, which quotes an IntuiShip employee
as stating that IntuiShip does its entire domestic small parcel shipping through Stamps.com.
2 Another that we have identified is that its
website redirects to www.Stamps.com!
STMP has been non-transparent with shareholders, inadequately disclosing how it derives the majority of its profitability and the likelihood
it could disappear; Wall Street analysts have no clue about how STMP is actually generating the majority of its financial results (STMP
consistently obliterates Wall St consensus estimates), or that the aforementioned earnings stream should not be capitalized with any real
multiple. As a result, STMP has been successful in its efforts to inflate its stock price beyond reasonable measure. Based on our analysis,
STMP is worth ~$15 per share, ~80% below current trading levels.
STMP has found a way to game the USPS postage reseller program  Our research into Stamps.com uncovered curious and undisclosed
relationships between Stamps.com and postage reseller companies (e.g., IntuiShip) that caught our attention, as the relationships
emerged around the same time that Stamps.com began its 1) M&A binge, and 2) ascension to Wall Street darling status due to its
consistent ability to mysteriously blow out Wall Street earnings expectations. Our research, including a review of hundreds of pages of
litigation as well as a deep forensic accounting analysis, has led us to conclude that Stamps.com has found a way to game postal rates
using the USPS postage reseller program.
Our research indicates that Stamps.com has partnered with certain undisclosed Utah-based postage resellers in order to recharacterize
low-volume shipping customers that would not qualify for USPS discounts as high-volume shipping customers that would. In doing so, we
believe that Stamps.com has found a way to skim undeserved revenues off the USPS. Further, we believe that Stamps.com, using postage
reseller discounts, is part of a larger scheme to buy USPS postage at discounted rates applicable to only high-volume shippers, and then
resell that postage to customers at the standard marked up rate, effectively capturing an arb spread. We think that this scheme results
in Stamps.com massively juicing its profits despite adding no economic value to the USPS.
STMPs application of the USPS postage reseller program appears to violate the intent and purpose of this program  The USPS
created the postage reseller program in 2009 to compete with Fedex and UPS. The program consisted of the USPS offering negotiated
discounted rates for Priority and Express Mail through Negotiated Service Agreements (NSAs) to certain intermediary companies
(postage resellers). The intent of the program was for the postage resellers to source new customers  specifically, high-volume
shipping end users  for the USPS. The program was meant to benefit both the USPS and the reseller: the postage reseller would keep
the difference between the price they charged the end user and the discounted rate negotiated with the USPS; in receiving new
customers, the USPS would grow.",Other information,Customer retention issues;related party transactions,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Stamps.com Inc. ,Nasdaq,fy2016,1,,Stamps.com Inc.,IQ34730,Internet and Direct Marketing Retail,NasdaqGS:STMP,106.932,364.305,75.229,1.511,62.972,19.152,108.443,62.972,0,62.756,301.333,33.949,62.756,148.955,0,3.5,32.158,-6.51,184.28,0,0,56.999,0,20.135,36.829,120.22,-0.195,0,-3.246,0,336.732,116.974,0,610.129,0,148.047,0.977,116.974,-7.75,15.554,41.745,0,6.329,75.229,-56.02,0,0,0,96.392,0,0,141.025,75.229,8.564,0,0,-55.206,0,0,2.241,237.417,75.229,0,0,75.229,2.241,0.053,4.36237,0,-229.715,4.36237,-14.639,-252.981,17.245,-14.639,372.712,4.12,15.15,372.712,4.12,-80.571,610.129,18.251,0,4.23942,0,4.00574,43525,42735,139.372,0,16.897,139.372,-51.035,16.84782,41.806,(Invalid Formula 0me),120.22,22.05788,142.372,35.98,3,2.856,2.12937,73.10875,4.832,162.908,0,-12.398,21.883,35.6874,65.9975,141.025,0,67.8455,54.465,3.552,52.643,535.62,8.122,131.622,700,33.623,933

Luma added that StoneMor was a roll-up of acquired properties but that the company could not make significant enough acquisitions to offset potential same-store sales declines or grow sufficiently to service the new capital. Luma also said that StoneMor's unique accounting suggested it had generated $250 million more of operating income than traditional measures, and Luma questioned whether StoneMor's projected profit for future services was overstated. Luma noted additional issues including a lack of accountability, misaligned incentives and complicated trust law, and it said that the price of the limited partnership units would likely decline in value rapidly.","StoneMor is a roll-up focused on acquiring growth by buying properties and businesses, but one

that does not provide any metrics on a same-store sales basis, making it practically impossible

for investors to determine whether the partnership is operating these acquired properties with

prowess. Based on the information the partnership does provide, we believe that the

companys operations located in states in which the partnership has not made recent

acquisitions are, on average, generating declining sales of interment spaces. In 2015, the

number of interment spaces sold in states in which there has not been an acquisition since 2013

declined by more than 9%. (Those same operations saw a decline of nearly 4% during the prior

year.) Unlike prior years, the partnership did not provide revenue by state for 2015, making an analysis

of actual same-store sales dollars impossible. That said, we do know that the same store

state that grew the number of interment spaces sold the most between 2013 and 2014

(Maryland) did so while the revenue in Maryland per interment space sold fell more than 10%,

suggesting that the company was forced to buy growth though discounting.1

More generally, If the chart above reflects StoneMors operations and revenue generation

overall, StoneMor will have to make acquisitions just to maintain sales at a constant pace. Such

acquisitions are costly and will force the partnership to take on additional debt or dilute unit

holders through new partnership unit issuance.

 StoneMor is structured as a public, tax-driven master limited partnership (unlike other

companies in the industry), leading to regulatory restrictions that impact, among other things,

the assets that can be owned and the capital structure. And, yet, if the partnership were

organized as a corporation, like most publicly traded companies, it would not likely face a tax

burden since the partnership generates pre-tax losses and has for more than seven years. Since

2000, the partnership has, in aggregate, generated pre-tax operating losses of more than $100

million.2

 StoneMor reports to investors using pro forma income statements that vary wildly from

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, using rules that the partnership itself determines

and has the power to modify at will over time. In the last five years, the partnerships unique

accounting system suggests the company has generated $250 million more of operating income

than traditional measures. Although the partnership has said that over time these proprietary

measures of the companys performance would begin to converge with GAAP results, 2015

produced the widest divergence in the numbers in many years, with GAAP operating income of

$1.3 million, while the partnership claimed adjusted operating income of $67.8 million.3",Strategy,too many acquisitons;accounting misrepresentation;organic growth overstated,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Stonemor Partners L.P.,NYSE,fy2016,1,,StoneMor Partners L.P.,IQ9620336,Specialized Consumer Services,NYSE:STON,12.57,326.23,-32.499,0,151.278,12.899,12.57,151.278,-0.819,77.253,174.952,1.147,77.253,144.634,0,12.4,0,-22.816,118.821,12.899,0,530.692,0,10.321,455.596,-2.886,54.135,0,-24.488,0,135.874,-27.374,0.743,1787.013,-1.52,22.767,17.247,-28.894,-11.382,0,1.589,2.803,1.775,-30.483,-10.55,0,0,0,38.893,0,0,300.351,-32.499,0,0,0,-19.129,-1.914,-0.5,0,1596.659,-32.499,229.595,0,-32.499,229.595,192.268,-0.93922,0,0,-0.93922,-243.984,0,34.602,-243.984,192.268,-0.94,94.314,190.354,-0.94,0,1787.013,34.602,0,-0.55271,0,-0.55271,43298,42735,10.013,-74.754,37.8635,10.013,-6.221,37.8635,-2.583,(Invalid Formula 0me),-2.886,5.07793,14.013,56.394,4,20.124,1.4894,-19.12475,2.875,302.126,0,-14.389,1.775,NM,-19.04675,300.351,NM,-3.74175,289.556,24.488,4.602,492.48,0.847,-1.369,0,0.742,934

The company said that it had no knowledge of legal proceedings or government inquiries that had been made against the company or its chief executive officer, based on any claims described in the report.  ","Recently disclosed court documents show that Sinovac Biotech's CEO bribed a member of the Chinese Food and Drug Administration to assist its vaccine clinical trial and approval.

Bribery is a clear violation of Foreign Corrupt Practices Act regulations and is prohibited for SEC registered companies like SVA; it could lead to criminal prosecution and fines.

We believe that non-disclosure of these actions taken by SVA's CEO is a clear violation of both SEC and NASDAQ regulations.

We believe this revelation jeopardizes the company's two outstanding non-binding go private offers and could also impact future CFDA approvals and the company's cash flow.

We believe U.S. regulators and Chinese FDA officials will investigate these allegations, as well as potential implications for all of SVA's past and future vaccines.",Legal Headwinds,failure to disclose material adverse information;legal headwinds;legal,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,Sinovac Biotech Ltd. ,Nasdaq,fy2016,1,,Sinovac Biotech Ltd.,IQ7631121,Biotechnology,NasdaqGS:SVA,62.434,72.431,-0.596,0,22.393,5.063,62.434,22.393,0,48.458,50.038,2.409,49.832,41.98,0.143,14.102,12.648,-15.122,130.747,0,-3.025,105.284,0,2.739,66.882,0.982,-4.959,0,-1.035,1.72,0,0.084,0,211.355,-0.478,-15.316,1.834,-0.394,-12.654,31.279,2.664,0.026,2.304,-3.058,0,0,2.338,0.861,66.264,0,0,9.448,-0.596,0,0,0,-11.776,13.899,0,0,81.689,-0.596,45.462,0,-2.934,45.462,0.057,-0.01047,0,2.874,-0.05152,-24.85,0,56.94908,-24.85,115.767,-0.01047,0.315,129.666,-0.05152,0,211.355,56.94908,0,0.0031,0,0.0031,43231,42735,6.045,0,57.01176,6.045,27.784,57.01176,-1.4,(Invalid Formula 0me),0.982,2.03058,7.099,115.767,1.054,1.662,2.03058,0.1765,1.885,43.031,0,20.612,33.583,NM,-10.29,9.448,0,-9.18625,-19.403,0.251,4.865,172.697,3.671,-6.609,724,-1.007,936

We obtained 2014 and 2015 SAIC files for SGFI beverage subsidiaries in July and again in August.

Iceberg said that Tutor Perini would take 33 years to repay its existing net debt of $622 million, based on its average operating cash flow. Iceberg said that Tutor Perini's inability to generate cash could be partially explained by growth in its costs and estimated earnings. Iceberg said that it believed Tutor Perini's costs and estimated earnings had been strongly overvalued and that it faced substantial contingent liabilities compared to its peers. Iceberg said that the large gap between costs and estimated earnings to be realized and operating cash flow every year strongly suggested recoverability issues. Iceberg said that Tutor Perini had not paid dividends since 2010 and is restricted by its banks from doing so.","Iceberg initiates coverage on Tutor Perini (TPC). The companys issues are not restricted to the unbilled. Tutor Perini has an impressive number of structural problems that, we believe, are underestimated by the market.     Summary of findings:     Tutor Perini (Tutor) is a $1.5b market cap company, but it has recorded only $3m in operating cash flow (OCF) since 2010. Tutor has not paid dividends since 2010.     Although Tutor records positive OCF quarters periodically, due to the fact that its revenue is amassed in lump sums and seasonal, its overall ability to generate cash has been structurally weak. Based on its average OCF since 2014, it would take 33 years to repay its existing net debt of $622m.     Tutors stock surged by 47% after Trumps election. The President-elect pledged to spend $1 trillion over 10 years on infrastructure without raising new taxes. The sketchy plan wouldtranslate into a 60% increase in annual infrastructure spending. However, experts have alreadyexpressed strong doubts over the feasibility of a plan that relies entirely on private funding.     Tutors inability to generate cash has been partially explained by the growth in its unbilled. We have compared the annual expectations of unbilled realization and actual OCF. Based on this analysis, we have strong doubts regarding the recoverability of these assets.     Although Tutor presents its unbilled as a straightforward collection issue, in reality clients often counter-sue Tutor, for example for false claims. We analyzed Tutors legal cases and found the situation particularly concerning. Tutor faces substantial contingent liabilities. In the past, Tutor had recognized insufficient provisions for these liabilities, even though it was clear that Tutors legal position was very weak, and indeed they lost the lawsuit.     Large retainage ($542m), higher than competitors, suggests future collection issues.     We expect Tutor to continue to struggle to generate material OCF on a sustainable basis.     We think the market is unaware of the fact that banks have been actively reducing their exposure on Tutor. Tutors interest expenses jumped by 32% in 9M 2016. Recently, the company had to withdraw a $500m bond offering as the pricing was too high.     Governance is very weak, especially for a US company: directors on the compensation committee have been independent for an average of 14 years, shareholders votes on remuneration policy have been systematically ignored, same auditor for the past 15 years, etc.     Almost half of the shares of Chairman and CEO, Ronald Tutor, who controls 19.6% of shareholding, are pledged as collateral for a line of credit.     Based on cash flow valuation, we expect the stock to fall by at least 55%.

Cable Car said that its recent bond redemption and loss of a lease financing partner suggested that Tesla's ability to raise capital might not be infinite, and it said that if the SolarCity ""bailout"" was ultimately consummated, Tesla could risk financial distress in even a minor economic downturn. Cable Car also noted the ""apples-to-oranges nature"" of comparing Tesla's Autopilot statistics to the safety record of all vehicles, which Cable Car said gave the false impression that driving a Tesla with Autopilot was safer than driving without Autopilot.","I believe the legend of Mr. Musks visionary genius is greatly exaggerated; I see him as a common
promoter who has been unusually successful in raising money by appealing to popular imagination and adopting a willingness to distort the truth. Lets see if I retain any friends in the Bay Area.
Cable Car recently increased its long-standing TSLA short position from immaterial bragging rights
size to a more meaningful position. Let me preface discussion by noting that shorting TSLA is unlikely to be profitable as long as the company retains unfettered ability to raise capital. For this reason, I have long viewed
the short position as little more than a beta hedge of sorts against a change in the overall market
environment. That is still the case. However, I increasingly believe TSLA to be a stock promotion scheme rife with conflicts of interest that is showing signs of having run its course. The recent bond redemption and loss of a lease financing partner suggest that its ability to raise capital may not be infinite. If the SCTY bailout is ultimately consummated, TSLA could risk financial distress in even a minor economic downturn.I am not going to lay out the full fundamental case against Teslas valuation, which has been wellestablished
elsewhere. You cannot conclusively disprove a hypothetical. TSLA is one of those widely covered
situations where I believe one can add value primarily by interpreting the available data and making portfolio anagement decisions rather than performing unique analytical work. Indeed, I have deliberately outsourced some of my fundamental work in this case. Online, I follow a small army of analysts who track every development at the company for free. Thanks to a number of smart obsessives, one can easily keep a close
pulse on everything from the many unannounced executive departures to new vehicle sales in Scandinavia. Mr. Musks pledges are extensively documented, both the verbal ones he has failed to keep and the incremental half billion dollars of his TSLA and SCTY holdings he has taken personal loans against since the beginning of the year.
There is a stark difference at law between promotional language in the context of selling a product or
service and promotional language in the service of raising capital. As with a certain political candidate, it becomes quite difficult following outrageous statement after outrageous statement to pick a particularly egregious omission or arguably material misrepresentation that justifies a skeptical stance. However inured the market may be to unrealistic forward-looking commentary, close examination of TSLA inevitably reveals something that should cause a reasonable investor to lose trust in the company. TSLA is a popular short, and I imagine each manager had a moment in which it became clear that there were too many red flags to ignore.
Maybe it was a particularly pie-in-the-sky production timeline, or maybe it was a non-GAAP accounting
gimmick too obvious to dismiss. Perhaps it was too stage-managed a press event, too self-serving a related party transaction, or too self-aggrandizing a falsehood about Brady bonds told to a biographer. Maybe the hagiography in general was simply off-putting enough to peek behind the curtain.

Few companies have ever managed such a broad scope of business models. Its
valuation multiples (when they can be calculated) lie well above its direct business model comparables ? TSLA is attempting more vertical integration than any auto company has recently tried ?

Software companies: TSLA has low / negative margins and heavy fixed asset commitment ? Social media companies: TSLA has no network effects, no platform economics and high scaling costs ? Biotech or oil explorations companies: TSLA has high marginal costs for every unit it produces
 TSLA has relied heavily on existing technology in designing a successful EV model, and while it may have generated some
valuable IP it now controls little of it and has questionable sustainable competitive advantage in technology ? TSLAs patents cover battery-related technology and selected components but not battery cells ? TSLAs patent holdings are dwarfed by its technology competitors, limiting its freedom to operate in the EV market
where its technology position is modest ? TSLAs engineering talent is thin relative to competitors and many productive inventors have left ? TSLAs valuable inventions can be readily copied by its EV competitors ? TSLAs cost position is heavily dependent on its bargaining positions with strategic suppliers who have an incentive to
price aggressively for their advanced technologies
 TSLA is not the green company it claims to be, with environmental risks at all stages of the vehicle lifecycle ? TSLA battery production requires the mining and use of numerous toxic chemicals ? TSLA EV production has a heavier carbon footprint than traditional vehicles ? TSLA vehicles consume lots of energy; battery charging shifts CO2 emissions from car engines to power plants ?

Lakewood said that investors were overlooking the business model's questionable economic value creation potential and an increasingly competitive market. It said that that replicating the results of 2U's first four programs would prove to be extremely difficult, and Lakewood said that many of the company's programs launched over the prior several years were likely tracking below 2U's targeted levels. Lakewood also said that 2U's 60% revenue share was at risk on new and renewal contracts and that the increasing number of competing programs would likely make attracting and retaining students for 2U programs significantly more costly.","Lakewood Capital  2U, Inc. (Short)     We are short 2U, Inc., a provider of online education programs, as we believe investors are overlooking the business models questionable economic value creation potential and an increasingly competitive market. The companys stock price has nearly tripled from its March 2014 IPO price of $13 per share due to a belief that 2Us addressable market offers a boundless growth opportunity that will enable the company to replicate the success of some lucrative early programs. This optimism is underscored by 2Us current market capitalization of $1.7 billion despite the company generating negative free cash flow every year since inception and forecasts calling for just $2 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2016.     2U partners with universities to create the online equivalent of their on-campus graduate programs. The company provides the technology platform for the courses and funds the startup costs and most of the operating costs associated with creating and running the programs including student recruitment. In return for these services, 2U receives approximately 60% of the tuition fees paid by students. 2U was founded in 2008 and launched its first four programs (the Core Four) between 2009 and 2011, focusing on four verticals (social work, nursing, business and education) and partnering with three top-tier institutions (University of Southern California, Georgetown and University of North Carolina). While these programs were successful, we believe that replicating the results of the Core Four will prove to be extremely difficult. Because 2U selected verticals with broad appeal and high tuition rates when online education was in its infancy, these programs were well-positioned to succeed. Most program verticals are not able to attract large enough class sizes or command the same high tuition levels. While 2Us most successful programs have been in the social work, nursing and business verticals, exclusivity terms with existing customers limit the number of programs 2U can launch in any one vertical. As a result, some of the companys more recent programs are in new niches such as speech pathology and health informatics, which we believe will struggle to reach the enrollment levels necessary to achieve the target program economics. While it is still early in their development, we suspect that many of the programs launched over the past several years are tracking below the companys targeted levels.     Not surprisingly, as the excitement around online education has grown, competition has also increased. Numerous universities and colleges currently operate their own online degree programs and a host of companies offer competing online platforms to 2U. In fact, several 2U customers have launched online degree programs that do not use 2U, including University of Southern California for its online Masters of Engineering and MBA programs, Georgetown for its Masters in Finance program and George Washington University for its online MBA program. As a result of this increased competition, we believe 2Us 60% revenue share is at risk on new and renewal contracts. Furthermore, the increasing number of competing programs will likely make attracting and retaining students for 2U programs significantly more costly, further pressuring the companys economics.     Finally, we believe the company is facing a meaningful headwind next year that many investors and analysts are overlooking. In November 2015, 2U extended its contract with University of Southern California for its Master of Social Work program, which is one of 2Us most successful programs (we estimate it accounted for more than 20% of 2015 revenues). In return for the extension as well as the loosening of restrictions on 2Us ability to partner with competing social work programs, 2Us share of tuition revenue will decline in three annual increments starting in 2017. In addition, 2U agreed to make two cash payments in 2017 and 2018 and agreed to additional contingent payments if revenues fall below a certain threshold. While the absolute amounts are redacted in the contract, given the programs significant contribution to total revenues, we think this renewal could prove to be a meaningful headwind in the coming years and is indicative of the companys tenuous position.     By applying a discounted cash flow analysis to each of 2Us existing programs and potential new program launches, we calculate a total value of $22 per share including cash and NOLs, roughly 40% below the current share price. As competition likely erodes program economics beyond what we modeled over time, we believe the downside in the companys share price could be even greater.

Hempton said that after two months had elapsed the company could appeal to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, but that the courts were ""pretty deferential"" to the patent examiners on the basis that they had the disinterested expertise to assess patents.

It said that ULTA's stores located within five miles of each other tripled from 2012 to 2015, that stores were increasingly opened in areas where more than 50% of the population had incomes below the company's target customer and that store-level gross margins had weakened. Prescience added that ULTA's higher transaction volume was the result of increased new store openings and that its transitory items including the ""demographic dividend"" would soon be cut short. Prescience also said that ULTA was ""about to hit a brick wall of revenue shortfalls"" due to cannibalization and slowing same-store sales, while at the same time face margin pressure from excess inventory. It added that ULTA's unusual capitalization of SG&A costs into inventory provided illusory margin improvement despite growing inventory levels.

On 9-20-2016, the company reported that a director had purchased an additional 11,000 shares.","Prescience Point has been following growth story retailer ULTA passively for a number of years now. It piqued our interest during the
2012  2013 timeframe, when a plethora of red flags surfaced potentially signaling slowing demand and/or market saturation:
? The trend in SSS began deteriorating in Q112 and declined rapidly into 2013
? In FY13, ULTA changed its definition of SSS to include e-commerce sales (which benefits headline SSS)
? Inventory levels appeared unmanageable, growing in excess of guidance and of forward quarter sales growth; DSI was steadily
moving higher
? Unusual string of executive-level turnover:
? 2 CFO resignations in 2012: 1.) 3/8/12: Gregg Bodnar resigns after serving for 6 years; 2.) 10/18/12: Bruce Hartman,
who was appointed CFO after an extensive search, resigns after serving for 6 weeks
? 2/14/13: CEO Chuck Rubin resigns after serving for 2.5 years
It was particularly interesting that on 6/6/2012, ULTA inexplicably increased its store count guidance from 1000 stores to 1200 stores, a
move having clear valuation implications. The move was concerning:
? Why would ULTA up its store count guidance as the business showed signs of deterioration?
? The increase seemed very premature > ULTA was only 47% penetrated on its initial guidance for 1000 potential stores (467
stores at Q112)
It was also troubling that, by our estimate, insiders sold ~$60m worth of stock between 6/8/2012 and 10/5/2012, in the period following
the announcement, and preceding further reported deterioration in 2013.
Despite the aforementioned red flags, ULTAs stock has doubled since the end of 2013 and currently trades at ~30x NTM P/E.
Paradoxically, the market cap/store has increased nearly 4x since 2010 and is currently close to all-time highs, even though the company
will be 97% saturated by FYE16 (based on the Companys initial guidance).",Overvalued by markets,Accounting misrepresentation;industry saturation;strategy issues;insider selling,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Ulta Salon, Cosmetics, & Fragrance, Inc.

On 8-17-2016, new anonymous short-seller Soapbox Research said that Ultimate Software Group manipulated margins through aggressive capitalization of research and development expenses in order to claim greater financial performance. Soapbox said that the company's revenues were heavily promoted by management, however Soapbox found that there were inconsistencies in the company's earnings calls and SEC filings. The short-seller also said that the company relied largely on stock compensation to further obfuscate its financials. The short-seller also pointed out that the chairman of the company's audit committee was the founder of Lason, a company that was found guilty of cooking its books.","Ultimate Software Group (
Ultimate, ULTI or 
the C
ompany),
 is a HCM (human capital management) provider. The company offers cloud-based software that helps clients streamline talent management, HR and payroll processes within their companies. Sell side firms tout that ULTI has the
best margins in SaaS
and that its
resilient business model and improving free cash flows make
it a resounding Buy. Company management boasts about their ability to grow recurring revenue by ~ 30% and double total company revenue in five
years time.
A
closer examination of the companys financials
, however, reveals these claims to be questionable at best. In stark contrast to the consensus views above, our analysis revealed the following: 1.
 
Aggressive capitalization inflates operating margins by more than double and appears to be a backdoor way for ULTI to capitalize product development costs. 2.
 
Disclosures about revenue and customers do not add up and suggest that ULTI has been grossly overstating numbers to investors. 3.
 
Revenue exaggeration and accounting chicanery at ULTI should come as no surprise given that the Chairman (Robert Yanover)
of ULTIs Audit
Committee was the Founder and Chairman of Lason, Inc, a company that was charged with accounting fraud (including falsifying revenues) in 2007. 4.
 
Stock-based compensation has grown at an accelerating pace. This has resulted in significant cash spend on share repurchases to settle employee tax liabilities and offset dilution which, when taken out of OCF, reveals that OCF and FCF is actually falling precipitously. 5.
 
The Scherr family and unrelated ULTI executives are unjustifiably enriched at the expense of shareholders.
We believe that once investors realize the magnitude of ULTIs exaggerated
claims, the company should trade down to its fair value of $101.15, implying a downside in excess of 50%.",Accounting Fraud,accounting misrepresentation;possibleAccounting Fraud;managerial self-dealing,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Ultimate Software Group, Inc.

VCRA Chairman Zollars was CEO or Chairman of 3 companies previously accused of fraud, 2 of which settled for a total of $709.8 million, the 3rd fraud is a possible $9 million VCRA securities fraud
We allege in this report that Zollars led his 4th fraud while at VCRA: 4 witnesses support our allegation we continually missed our forecasts quarter after quarterand proactively chose to use the backlog to smooth Voceras quarterly numbers
Insiders, including Silicon Valley venture capitalists and strategic partners, have sold more than $200 million of VCRA stock since IPO
Motorola was initially an investor, but sold its VCRA shares and is now a notable and better capitalized competitor than VCRA
VCRA has one product. Last major product launch in 2011, despite fact that 9 of 10 competitors we profiled (most of which are better capitalized) had major product launches in last 11 months
VCRAs product appears to be inferior, as made clear by nearly every measure considered (i.e. no touchscreen), yet it appears to be the most expensive product and has the highest apparent installation costs of any product we profiled
We found a plethora of users suggesting the VCRA device is terrible and that they are unsatisfied with its performance
Customer churn, which VCRA does not disclose regularly, appears to be approximately 18%, or about 1 in 5 customers, calculated in the aggregate since VCRAs inception
VCRA uses sales to uninformed customers to pump VCRAs stock, we spoke with Franciscan Alliance  VCRAs top new customer
VCRA CTO has admitted 15 defects in VCRAs sole product
VCRA aggregate losses total $109.8 million, -5.07% CAGR 2012-2015
VCRA has reported profits in 3 quarterly periods out of 16 total quarterly periods  however we allege an accounting fraud was underway during those 3 quarters
Markets movement towards app-based solutions could force VCRA to finance customer installations or offer steep discounts in order to compete

The Street Sweeper also said that Apple had immediately filed for a mistrial after the prior week's verdict and that it would likely take many years to resolve the case that had begun six years earlier. The Street Sweeper added that even though a prior Microsoft lawsuit had been settled in VirnetX's favor, VirnetX ended up with just 31% of the settlement, and it also said that the company's consistent losses and cash burn called into question whether it could survive until resolution of the Apple suit.

On 8-1-2016, VirnetX announced that the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division, had issued a new order in the company's pending litigation against Apple, vacating its previous order consolidating the two cases and ordering the parties to retry them as separate cases. VirnetX's shares closed down 44% that day.

On 9-9-2016, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board announced that Mangrove met its burden of showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that claims 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10 and 12 of VirnetX's '135 patent were unpatentable and that claims 1, 2, 68 and 1214 of the '151 patent were unpatentable.

On 10-03-2016 VirnetX announced that a jury in the United States Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division, in connection with the Apple I case, awarded the company $302.4 million. At the time of the announcement VirnetX had two pending patent infringement lawsuits against Apple. A jury trial for the Apple II case was expected to be scheduled by the court shortly after the conclusion of the Apple I case. VirnetX's shares closed 34% higher that day.","Shares of VirnetX Holding (VHC) have ridden an unfortunate rocket to the moon based on a court decision that Apple infringed on VirnetXs patents. But we believe the share price will crater as soon as the market understands the massive risks:

1. The Trend: No Settling

Patent trolling firms used to nab larger companies by the tail. But now these companies are beginning to fight - and win - these lawsuits filed by patent trolls. Case in point is Better Mouse Company's patent suit against SteelSeries.

Better Mouse apparently attained the title of patent troll because the company began buying up patents and launching patent lawsuits shortly after it was formed, according to Forbes. Before long, Better Mouse's chewing paid off as companies eager to push aside the pesky little troll coughed up $1.2 million just to settle matters.

But jurors jerked away Better Mouse's cheese on Jan. 14. They rejected the company's patent infringement claims against SteelSeries.

So will Apple really meekly hand VirnetX $625 million? That's unimaginable.

In fact ...

2. Many Years Before VirnetX Pockets A Dime  If Ever

Apple immediately filed for a mistrial after last weeks verdict of infringement on four VirnetX patents in products such as FaceTime and VPN services.

And VirnetXs attorney said he thinks it could take several more years to resolve the case that began six years ago, not near VirnetX's Nevada headquarters but in Tyler, Texas, ""the patent litigation capital of America.""

Meanwhile, VirnetX knows all too well that after spending countless hours and dollars litigating, cases sometimes go the wrong way. The company filed a $258 million patent lawsuit against Cisco in 2010 with what may have seemed to VirnetX astonishing results. In a stinging 2013 verdict, jurors determined Cisco had not infringed on VirnetX patents. VirnetX investors raced to the exits and shares plunged 28 percent.

     3. Microsoft Outcome Disappointing

Even when a lawsuit ends up being settled to VirnetX's favor, the results aren't as beneficial as we would hope. VirnetX won a March 2010 $200 million settlement against Microsoft. Yet, the lead counsel whacked away $20 million plus expenses; taxes took $34 million; and partner Science Application International Corp. $59.24 million, with more obligated.

Ultimately, the Microsoft windfall turned out to be a gentle breeze resulting in VirnetX receiving only about $63 million... Though the settlement did manage to push the negative earnings into a positive 91 cents, the company ended up with just 31 percent of the settlement.

     4. VirnetX Churns Out Misses, Massive Losses

But the company soon returned to negative earnings and double-digit and even triple-digit misses, as shown below.

Yet even in this financial environment, the two top executives are pulling down $2.8 million in compensation.



(Source: Salary.com from 2014 SEC filing)

Never mind that, with only $375,000 in revenue and $6 million in net losses last quarter, the company had to squeeze $741,000 from its ATM in order to keep operating.

At-the-market financing? Oh, yes...

      5. Insufficient Cash To Await Resolution: Potentially Dilutive Stock Sale Looms

Everywhere we look, the company's financials should effectively blow away any lingering investor hopefulness that the company can hold out until the Apple issue is resolved.

At the end of September, the company had less than $10 million in cash. Yet it burns through about $7.25 million per quarter.

So VirnetX should be almost out of cash now

Therefore investors must watch for a stock offering brimming with potential dilution.

In fact, the company has already set up a stock offering.

Through an at-the-market (ATM) offering in August, the company cleared the way to unleash millions of shares onto the market on a whim.

Is there even more related risk? Better believe it. Oh, yes. Options for more than 4 million shares are exercisable at this very moment.

Conclusion

It's not too shocking that under eight different methodologies for determining a stock's trading quality, VirnetX rated as low as 0% with the vast majority marking the company only about 20% ... one of the very worst scorecards weve ever seen, shown here.

But the rating is justified because VirnetX doesn't even qualify as a real company, in our book. Its consistent losses have already swept in a whopping $122 million deficit, on top of a 35 cent book value that cannot logically equal that screaming $400 million market valuation.

Lakewood said that it was uncertain that ViaSat would even generate a positive return on its roughly $600 million investment in ViaSat-1 considering the satellite's finite life, high customer acquisition costs and significant churn (roughly 30% annually). It said that satellites were structurally disadvantaged for consumer broadband and faced constantly improving competition, and Lakewood added that the untapped market for new customers was limited for ViaSat-2 and ViaSat-3.

On 11-15-2016, ViaSat announced that it had commenced an underwritten public offering of 6.5 million shares of its common stock.","Lakewood Capital ViaSat (Short)     In the fourth quarter of 2015, the fund initiated a short position in ViaSat, a provider of satellite-based broadband internet access. ViaSat primarily sells internet access to rural and suburban households lacking access to high quality wireless or wired alternatives. In addition, ViaSat has a government services business and an in-flight WiFi business. Despite a significant deterioration in earnings estimates, shares have increased 20% this year as an upbeat management team has sold investors on a bright future, filled with new satellite launches and future profits. We expect that the ViaSat of the future will look much like the ViaSat of today, which is a highly levered, barely profitable, low-margin, free cash flow negative business.     ViaSat owns two satellites, WildBlue-1 and ViaSat-1, and leases capacity on a third satellite, Anik F2. WildBlue-1 (launched in 2006) and Anik F2 (launched in 2004) are both nearing the end of their useful lives, and ViaSat-1 was launched in 2011, making it one of the first high throughput satellites to enter service. At the time of launch, there was a lot of excitement that a satellite would be able to offer internet speeds of up to 12 Mbps to consumers with limited alternatives. Analysts once believed that ViaSat-1 would add as many as one million new subscribers. However, five years after the satellite launched, ViaSat-1 has added just 300,000 new subscribers and customer growth has been stagnant for nearly two years. Considering the satellites finite life, high customer acquisition costs and significant churn (roughly 30% annually), it is uncertain that ViaSat will even generate a positive return on its roughly $600 million investment in ViaSat-1. ViaSat faces the tough reality that satellites are structurally disadvantaged for consumer broadband. While cable and wireless coverage and speeds are constantly improving, once a satellite is launched into space, the technology does not change. LTE speeds offered by the major wireless carriers are now comparable to ViaSat-1s top speeds and the basic internet tier from the top cable providers are even faster. Constantly improving competition also shortens the effective useful life of a satellite, which ideally would remain in service for nearly two decades.     A little more than five years after launching ViaSat-1, ViaSat is launching ViaSat-2 early next year and announced plans to build a three satellite constellation called ViaSat-3, which has an expected launch date of 2019 or 2020. While management has excited Wall Street with these new satellites and the prospect of a significant increase in customers, we believe that the untapped market for new customers is limited. Further, we view these launches as a tacit admission that the useful life of its assets is short and that the company has to spend significant sums on new satellites simply to stay competitive and maintain its subscriber base. Execution risk is heightened by the companys reliance on the capital markets to fund its plans as the balance sheet is already highly levered, and persistent historical negative free cash flows will likely continue for the next several years. We would also note that ViaSat faces competition from satellite provider Hughes, which is expected to launch its next generation satellite later this year, several months before the launch of ViaSat-2.     The stock has performed well this year largely due to the announcement of a couple of customer wins in its aviation business. In-flight WiFi represents less than 10% of company revenues, and ViaSat faces numerous competitors fighting for share in this category including the incumbent Gogo, other major satellite providers as well as AT&T and Verizon. While we anticipate growth in the coming years, we believe this business is unlikely to drive material value for the company.     Despite these challenges, ViaSat currently trades at 17x EBITDA when we deduct stockbased compensation and one-time proceeds from a legal settlement, more than double its peers in the industry. Given the capital intensity of the satellite business and the finite useful lives of the assets, we prefer to utilize an EBIT-based valuation approach, and even after accounting for the contribution from ViaSat-2, we estimate a valuation of nearly 30x EBIT (versus about 70x on current year EBIT). If the company were to trade at a generous multiple of 20x our estimate of fiscal year March 2019 EBIT, we arrive at a price target of about $40 per share or 45% below current levels.

The short-seller said that Energous' first commercial product was a technical failure, unable to charge phones at any meaningful distance effectively. Aristides also predicted that it would not gain FCC approval for its second product as - given the technology is based off of microwave radiation - it would have to ""interfere with WiFi and cook human flesh"" in order to achieve the wireless ranges the company had claimed.","Not all trades were winners. A trade that went against the fund was Energous (WATT). The company had shorted the stock, which has been in a strong uptrend since mid-January. In the fund letter, Brown alleged that the companys technology could cook human flesh and that it would not receive regulatory approval:

The companys first commercialized product will be a failure (basically it will be able to, with incredibly slowness, charge your phone wirelessly from a distance of three feet or less, provided your phone is at exactly the right angle). The companys second commercial product will interfere with WiFi and cook human flesh, and wont ever get FCC approval. Importantly, in addition to many competent people saying these things, I have heard with my own ears that the CEO is a ridiculous snake oil salesman, who seems to be following the exact script of Unipixel and ImageWare in his communication with investors and analysts.
When asked to cite studies to back up his claims, Brown made the following statement to ValueWalk:

Energous miracle technology is simply microwave radiation. The FCC-approved product, which is useless, will not cook flesh. We believe that math shows pretty plainly that in order to charge a phone meaningfully at the kind of distances they are talking about for their next-generation product (which notably does NOT have FCC approval), that the level of microwaves needed would both interfere with other devices, in addition to being above the safe threshold for human exposure, including the potential for damage to flesh from repeated, significant microwave exposure.",Product ineffective,product dangerous;product not as valuable as perceived;legal headwinds;regulatory headwinds,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,Energous Corporation ,Nasdaq,fy2016,1,,Energous Corporation,IQ240672662,Electrical parts,NasdaqCM:WATT,31.25864,1.45194,-45.81739,0,0,0.95784,31.25864,0,0,0.1495,1.45194,9.58896,0.1495,14.44998,0,0,32.83268,-0.1495,32.86351,0,0,4.34153,0,2.38279,2.20948,-45.83072,0.13196,0,0.01333,0,0,-45.81739,0,35.25894,0,-33.06225,4.70776,-45.81739,-1.13745,0,0,0,0,-45.81739,0,0,0,0,6.70772,0,0,0,-45.81739,0,0,0,-1.13745,0,0,0,6.70772,-45.81739,0,0,-45.81739,0,2.00E-04,-2.59603,0,-124.52457,-2.59603,0,0,17.64901,0,28.55122,-2.59603,36.11012,28.55122,-2.59603,-0.31268,35.25894,17.64901,0,-1.62252,0,-1.62252,43175,42735,-44.87288,0,20.36793,-44.87288,35.58577,20.36793,1.38607,(Invalid Formula 0me),-45.83072,1.40177,-44.7921,28.55122,0.08078,0,1.40177,-28.63587,0,0,0,0,0,0,-16.72982,0,0,-16.72982,-31.25864,0,-2.50503,28.55122,0,-46.01033,73,0,973

The Street Sweeper said that Energous' stock had been the subject of stock promotion campaigns in 2014 and 2015, and it said that the quality of the company's stock offerings were declining.","Judging by the stock buoyancy of Energous (WATT), you'd never know that the developer of wireless charging technology just announced it lost $10.3 million. And on a per share basis, that loss hit $0.62.

It seems the market missed the Santa Jose, California firm's comment near the bottom of the press release that it has a new investment ... which is dilutive.

Maybe the market is beginning to get bleary eyed reading yet another overly optimistic spin: ""With the new investment from Ascend Capital and our first silicon and royalty revenues expected before the end of this year, our financial position is secure.

Zatarra also said that Wirecard had defrauded Visa and MasterCard by undertaking a deliberate and premeditated scheme to obfuscate payment jurisdiction and associated merchant risk. Zatarra said it would notify U.S. authorities, European regulators and credit card companies of Wirecard's unlawful activities, and it added that the repercussions of using fraudulent methods to process payments and evade U.S. restrictions on internet gambling would result in sanctions for the company.

Soon after, Bloomberg reported that Wirecard said Zatarra's report contained ""wholly untrue"" and ""slanderous"" allegations, and it said that legal action had been initiated. 

Later, Bronte Capital said that it could not verify the assets that Wirecard had purchased that became corporate goodwill, and it added that it could not even confirm the existence of some businesses the company had purchased. Bronte said it had maintained a short ""for years.""

On 3-2-2016, Bloomberg reported that Wirecard's CEO said he saw no impact from Zatarra's report on the companys operational business, and Bloomberg also said that Germanys Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) had started investigating the earlier share price move for market manipulation.

On 3-7-2016, Zatarra published a follow-up report that said Wirecard had avoided publicly responding to the issues it raised and had instead disseminated false and misleading information to sell-side analysts and investors. It also said that having been confronted with evidence from UK Companies House, Wirecard admitted it did incorporate Wire Card UK Ltd., which Zatarra said directly connected Wirecard to online gambling companies and companies laundering money into the U.S. Zatarra also said that the U.S. Secret Service was becoming aware of new evidence demonstrating Wirecard's central involvement in transmitting unlawful monies into the U.S., and Zatarra said it would publish further evidence of Wirecard's false statements in due course."," Evidence shows that Wirecard Senior Officers and Board Members committed money

And, as the Wicked Witch of the West warned, this little partys just beginning.

The company has not responded to a request for comment but investors may find other viewpoints here.

Meanwhile, lets look at the reasons TheStreetSweeper believes this party will end badly, no matter how many times the company clicks its ruby slippers together.

*After 18 Years, Still No Product

The public vehicle has been in existence nearly two decades  since May 1998.

In those 18 years, the company has changed names, symbols and focus repeatedly but has not yet commercialized a single product.

At inception, the company rolled up two asset-free companies into subsidiaries. The first idea was to develop a spray window coating designed to convert sunlight into electricity. The second idea surrounded pursuit of technology to regenerate optic nerves.

But without a product, the company had no way to make money. So operations depended on selling stock and getting loans from its now-past president, Harmel S. Rayat. Investors will learn more about Mr. Rayat's background below.

*Dorothy: My, People Come And Go So Quickly Here! And So Do Names, Symbols And Product Ideas

The company switched the name to SolarWindow in March 2015. Previously, it was known as Octillion (OTCBB: OCTL) from 1998 until 2008, when the name was changed to New Energy Technologies (OTCBB: NENE).

And its product ideas changed quicker than you can say, Create a couple of subsidiaries and spin off the nerve regeneration loser.

The spun-off nerve regeneration business reports $0 revenue, $0 cash flow and a share price that plummeted from an awful 43 cents to an atrocious zero:



Meanwhile, the parent company relied on Mr. Rayat's funding while it desperately tried to connect the dots between a report in 2007 and its idea:

The exceptional power performance of these silicon nanoparticles is a substantial achievement, and is especially significant since our use of these same nanoparticles is key to the development of Octillions transparent glass windows capable of generating electricity, an innovation that I believe can potentially reduce the harmful environmental impact associated with traditional electrical power generation, explained Mr. Harmel S. Rayat, President and CEO of Octillion Corp.

In 2009, the company found something new to hype: MotionPower a proposal to generate electricity by harvesting wasted energy from vehicles in motion.

Heres part of the companys pitch:

Engineers envision that wasted kinetic energy from the movement of an estimated 6,000,000 trucks and 250,000,000 cars on America`s roadways could serve as a potentially viable source for generating valuable electricity 

But the company announced on March 2, 2015 that it had abandoned this product idea, too.

Oddly, it touted the MotionPower brand two days later, here, in a release stating New Energy had been renamed SolarWindow.

SolarWindows revenues and losses made it clear that it was high time for the company to settle down and focus. But the efforts have continued to fail.



 

* Pay No Attention To That Man Behind The Curtain, Or Who Is SolarWindows Chief Creditor?

Let's pull back the curtain to get a closer look at SolarWindow's great benefactor and chief creditor.

That money guy is Harmel Rayat, an entrepreneur who is particularly adept at promoting his book, speaking engagements and investment website, plus establishing leadership positions in various disappointing companies.

Mr. Rayat was ordered by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2003 to cease and desist certain activities related to the way his now-defunct stock promotion entity, EquityAlert, pushed another company in which he held various leadership roles, Innotech. Mr. Rayat and his EquityAlert agreed to settle with a civil penalty totaling $40,000.

Now SolarWindow's chief creditor has agreed to extend the maturity date to 2017 of its $3 million loan - and is now able to resell 6 million shares of stock.

Meanwhile, analysts and institutional investors have virtually ignored SolarWindow, leaving the vast majority of the company in the hands of Mr. Rayat and his entities.

Though his ownership may not be obvious through a glance at SEC filings, Kalen Capital Corp.(below) is wholly owned by Mr. Rayat. The other two entities link to his children.

This is not a good situation from investors viewpoint. As SEC filings warn: Mr. Rayat may be able to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, and will have significant control over our management and policies.

*Big Promoters

Disclosure of professional promotions provided by some big, well-known stock promoters is something else SolarWindow likely doesn't want investors to know.

The most recent promotion occurred just last March. As indicated by the chart below, the promotional effort seemed to help spark the current stock rally  from about $1.50 to above $2 - the very rally we believe has positioned the stock for a great fall.

Investors can see below that SolarWindow, under its previous name of New Energy, was hyped by various stock promoters a stunning 23 times over the years.

Promoters include names like The Cheap Investor, Small Cap Voice, Cool Penny Stocks and Lebed Biz, an entity of Jonathan Lebed, now 31, who at 15 became the youngest person to be prosecuted by the SEC for stock manipulation.

SolarWindow reminds TheStreetSweeper of Sphere 3D (NASDAQ: ANY), another overvalued company with no real products, promoted by Mr. Lebed and others.

Solid companies with actual products dont have to rely on stock promoters to prop up the stock. And neither should investors.

*Cash Poor, Big Burn, Excessive Executive Compensation

It's no surprise the company has disclosed substantial doubt that it will continue as a going concern and adds it must have more equity raises ... But we wonder who would want more stock in this company?

SolarWindow's cash and equivalents had fallen to around $229,000 as of the end of its year in August, even as it burns through nearly $650,000 quarterly. Even with a recent bridge loan from Mr. Rayat's Kalen Capital, the company can barely scrape by.

Yet look at executive compensation:



(Source: SEC filings)

Compensation for CEO John Conklin in 2014 - $2.1 million - was three times the company's entire ~$620,000 R&D budget. Though compensation dropped below research spending in 2015, the situation still raises questions about company priorities under such dire circumstances.



John Conklin, President, CEO, Director

(Source: SolarWindow)

Additionally, Mr. Conklin's education and public company leadership arguably doesn't justify that lofty compensation. He's been with SolarWindow since 2010 and his prior experience includes studying chemical engineering, consulting and founding two companies so small they are difficult to find on the Internet:

John A. Conklin. Mr. Conklin is founder of Tellurium Associates, LLC, an industrial and environmental process design and operations consulting company, and founder of National Solar Systems, LLC, a New York based renewable energy firm. Mr. Conklin has studied chemical engineering, chemical technology, and numerous industrial, safety and renewable energy programs. With 26 years of industrial process and renewable and alternative energy experience, Mr. Conklin has consulted regarding and overseen the technical and business requirements of over 50 technology, manufacturing and industrial companies, ranging from start-ups to Fortune 500 companies, including industry leaders such as Lockheed Martin and TDI Power, a global manufacturer of power systems. Mr. Conklin serves as our President and Chief Executive Officer and brings a combination of technical, business and hands-on alternative and renewable energy experience.

Indeed, records indicate Tellurium Associates is located in an Apalachin, N.Y. residence, shown here:

*Limited Experience, Limited Information On New Hire

And the limited public company experience theme continues with SolarWindow's recent appointment of Patrick Sargent as vice president of product development and engineering. Mr. Sargent has worked for several companies but the company fails to disclose two interesting factors:

First, Mr. Sargent isnt new to SolarWindow. He joined the board in 2012, when SolarWindow was operating as New Energy Technologies.

Second, the company also fails to disclose what would seem to be Mr. Sargents strongest leadership position  as president and CEO of Corona Solar Group.

Why would SolarWindow forget to mention Mr. Sargents what should be the most impressive  and most recent  leadership position?

Maybe because this solar installation company is so small that it operates out of a house in Georgia, a house that records indicate is Mr. Sargents residence:

*Conclusion:

In The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy said: If we walk far enough, we shall sometime come to someplace.

But SolarWindow has walked for nearly two decades without getting anyplace.

The solar company is melting away fast in a low oil price environment. Despite its outlandish ~$91 million market cap, it has relatively inexperienced leadership, no commercial product, no revenue, and no means of support beyond additional stock offerings and an SEC-sanctioned serial promoter's loans.

Theres just no future here, no comfy home in Kansas just beyond the rainbow. The companys own SEC filings say investors should be aware it is unlikely to sell anything in the near future and may not be able to raise more cash.

It's not easy to put a value on what is probably the worst company we've ever covered. About $0.25 per share would be a reasonable valuation for SolarWindow.",Overvalued by markets,Product ineffective;Stock promotion;Ineffective management/staff;Cash shortage,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"SolarWindow Technologies,Inc.

Kerrisdale also questioned the efficacy of the drug, and it said that beloranib had lead to 4-5% weight loss and only moderate behavioral improvements while quadrupling patients' annual mortality rate. Kerrisdale additionally noted that beloranibs history as a drug to block blood-vessel growth, combined with the propensity of angiogenesis inhibitors to cause blood clots, further suggested that the drug was dangerous. It said that beloranib was on a complete clinical hold and that the FDA would not approve the drug, and Kerrisdale noted that Zafgen had little else in its pipeline.

On 7-19-2016, after the market had closed, Zafgen announced that it was suspending further development of beloranib. Shares closed down 52% the next day.","Zafgen is a biopharmaceutical company on the brink of extinction. From its founding in 2005,
Zafgens big idea, in the words of one piece of early press coverage, was to fight fat by cutting
off its blood supply. After licensing a drug called beloranib that was originally designed to inhibit
angiogenesis (the development of new blood vessels) in order to treat cancer, Zafgen ultimately
focused its development efforts on PraderWilli syndrome (PWS), a rare genetic disorder in
which a specific group of genes is missing or unexpressed, leading to an array of problems,
including obesity and hyperphagia (extreme over-eating and food-seeking).
But Zafgens work has ended in tragedy. In October, the company announced that a beloranib
patient in its Phase 3 PWS trial died from pulmonary embolism  blood clots in the lungs
arteries. The FDA put a partial clinical hold on the drug but allowed Zafgen to continue the trial.
Beloranib patients were only put back on the drug after being screened for existing thrombotic
[i.e. clotting-related] disease and were then regularly monitored to ensure safety.
Nonetheless, in December another beloranib patient died, also from pulmonary emboli, leading
the FDA to apply a complete clinical hold. Moreover, Zafgen disclosed that other beloranib
patients had experienced an additional seven (non-fatal) thrombotic events. (Meanwhile, no
placebo patients died, and no placebo patients suffered from thrombotic events.) With Zafgens
only well-developed drug candidate now revealed to be woefully dangerous  even in the face
of enhanced screening and monitoring  its stock price collapsed.
But hope springs eternal. Last Wednesday, Zafgen released results from the Phase 3 PWS trial
indicating that beloranib had statistically significant positive effects on weight and hyperphagia.
The companys stock price rallied 79%, and multiple sell-side analysts issued new buy ratings.
But this reaction is absurd. Nothing meaningful has changed: beloranib is highly dangerous but
only modestly effective.",Product ineffective,FDA approval unlikely;product ineffective,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Zafgen, Inc.",Nasdaq,fy2016,1,,"Zafgen, Inc.",IQ29016215,Biotechnology,NasdaqGS:ZFGN,32.352,0,-57.878,96.842,0,0.212,129.194,0,0,0,0,10.113,0.347,17.348,0,0,39.474,0,130.899,0,0,0.981,0,-4.625,0.661,-56.822,0,0,0.365,0,0,-56.475,0,131.621,-1.403,-51.975,2.572,-57.878,-0.66,0,0,0,3.589,-57.878,0,0,0,0,9.894,0,0,0,-57.878,52.072,0,0,51.447,0,-1.403,0,9.894,-57.878,0,0,-57.878,0,0.027,-2.12023,0,-237.549,-2.12023,-2.935,0,27.29793,-2.935,121.727,-2.12023,0.22,121.727,-2.12023,0,131.621,27.29793,0,-1.29302,0,-1.29302,43168,42735,-56.61,0,27.33255,-56.61,-2.715,27.33255,-3.243,(Invalid Formula 0me),-56.822,4.45355,-56.21,121.727,0.4,0.388,4.45355,-35.29688,0,3.589,0,-2.935,3.589,0,-32.15538,0,0,-31.82475,-125.605,0.529,5.976,125.316,0,-57.27,32,0,982
