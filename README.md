# hedge-fund-project
This will be the main ReadMe file that includes a description of the project, 
explanation of the file structure, and other pertinent information for this project.


This project starts with the "Data (in progress)" Folder:
The data folder contains the original data downloaded from Sharkwatch (activist hedge fund campains) and S&P Capital IQ (the 
financial information for the companies targeted by the hedge fund).

The "Images" folder includes all relevant charts we decided to keep as it informs our paper.

The folder "Output" contains 2 key types of files: 1. HTML files of the regression results we decided to keep, and 
2. data charts created to help us understand effects by industry, and by type of complaint made by the hedge fund.

The "Scripts" folder contains all RMD code created, and the "Report" folder will contain the final report.
